           * on the iPad hero. The cap stays as a belt for a column wider than 1200.
           *
           * The share is a two-anchor RAMP and not one number, because the two frames do not
           * agree on it: `1297:349` is 727.492 of a 1200 column (60.6243%) and `1190:1472` is
           * 205.987 of a 354 one (58.1884%). Held flat at 60.6243% the phone mark measured
           * 214.6 against Figma's 206 — 8.6px, on the largest object above the fold. Written
           * through both anchors it is 58.1884% at 402 and exactly 60.6243% at `--fl` = 1, so
           * 1440 does not move: 60.6243% of 1200 is 727.49.
           *
           * `tan(atan2(var(--fl), 1px))` and not `2.4993% * var(--fl)`, because `--fl` is a
           * LENGTH — `clamp(0px, calc((100vw - 375px) / 1065), 1px)` — standing in for a 0..1
           * ratio. Every other ramp in this codebase multiplies it by a bare number and adds
           * px, so length x number = length and it resolves; a PERCENTAGE times a length is
           * invalid, the declaration survives parsing (it contains `var()`) and only collapses
           * at computed-value time, where `width` resets to `auto`. Measured in that state: the
           * mark drew 354 wide at 402 and the full 652 column at 768 — the exact `w-full` bug
           * this line exists to fix, silently reintroduced. `tan(atan2(l, 1px))` is the repo's

                It is now the ONE h1 on the site that spells its ramp out instead of wearing
                `fl-display` (28 → 40), because this string is long enough that the rank's floor
                decides how many lines it takes. `1190:1492` sets it at 20px/1.4 in the 354
                column and boxes the result 84 tall — three lines of 28. `fl-display` gave 28.304
                at 402, and this title measures 722.16 at 20px against the font, so at 28.304 it
                is 1022.0 in a 354 measure: 2.89 lines of content that Thai word-boundary
                breaking plus the unbreakable " (BangMod Hackathon)" token cannot pack into
                three, hence the four the report shows.

                `fl-display`'s exact ceiling and does not move. That 40 is deliberately NOT
                Figma's own desktop 30 (`1297:369`, a 1081-wide single line): the ladder in
                index.css is calibrated against /register's 40px page title at 1440 and owns
                that end.

                Three lines at 402, arithmetically rather than visually (no browser here):
                722.16 of text in a 354 measure needs at least ceil(722.16 / 354) = 3 lines —
                two lines hold only 708 — and three lines carry 1062, so it fits with the first
                two needing just 52% fill. Both bounds are hard, so it is exactly 3. The
                measurement is trustworthy: the same advance-sum puts `1297:369` at 1083.24
                against Figma's own 1081 and `708:489` at 216.40 against its 217. */}

                longest block of copy above the fold, which is why the phone hero ran 4.5 lines
                past Figma's box (measured 145.1 and 217.7 tall against the frame's 126 and
