/**
 * Figma 708:1174 (1440x1024, desktop) / 1214:127 (402x874, phone) — "Registration
 * Requirements", the gate that lists what to bring before the wizard opens.
 *
 * Both frames are EXACTLY viewport-height and both mark the requirement list as the only
 * clipping box in the tree, which is Figma's way of saying the page does not scroll and the
 * list does. The phone frame proves it: `1214:144` is 511 tall with 550 of content in it and
 * `clipsContent: true`, so the last teacher line is cut mid-sentence in Figma's own render.
 * See the scroll contract on the card below.
 */

/**
 * Figma crops the student illustration inside its box rather than fitting it, so the two
 * mascots carry different image treatments. `1214:146`/`708:1194` is a STRETCH fill with
 * `imageTransform [[0.875, 0, 0.10372], [0, 1, -0.0016285]]`, i.e. the box shows the source
 * from x 0.10372 to 0.97872 and y -0.0016285 to 0.99837 — which is 1/0.875 = 114.2857% of the
 * box wide, offset -0.10372/0.875 = -11.8542% and 0.16285% down. `1214:151`/`708:1199` is a
 * plain FILL with no transform, so it is `object-cover` centred.
 *
 * The insets live on percentage `width`/`height` and never on `inset` alone: an absolutely
 * positioned replaced element with `width: auto` renders at its INTRINSIC size and the
 * over-constrained edge is discarded (CSS 2.1 §10.3.7), which is why the fitted mascot is
 * `block size-full` rather than `inset-0`.

         * first line above the scroll origin and makes it unreachable. `safe` falls back to
         * `start` exactly when it overflows, and where it is unsupported the whole
