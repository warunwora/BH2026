 * Figma 708:1952 at 1440 and `1243:2161` at 402. Two groups of rounded rows: mandatory documents
 * that open a modal, then per-topic consents answered with a check pair. The consent rows carry 24
 * of right padding where the document rows carry 12, so the row padding is passed in.
 *
 * THE PHONE ANCHOR MOVES. The earlier pass read this step off the `1297:14xx` run, which belongs
 * to the Privacy Policy Modal frame (`1297:1433`) — the terms step drawn UNDER a scrim. The step's
 * own 402 frame is `1243:2161`, and where the two disagree it wins. Every id below is from it.
 *
 * TYPE is now written out rather than left on `fl-20` / `fl-18`. Figma's phone values are lower
 * than either rank's floor — `1243:2389` is a 16 title over a 12 description, against a floor of
 * 17 and 16 — so the ranks were carrying the phone 1px and 4px over the frame. The rule is now
 * that a measured phone value beats the ladder, so each one is a two-anchor ramp at its call site.

/**
 * The row's leading mark, and it has TWO phone anchors for one 1440 value — which is why the
 * size is a prop rather than a constant.
 *
 * Figma draws every one of these 40 square at 1440 (`708:1995` hand, `708:2004` document,
 * `724:393` image, `724:405` stethoscope, `724:401` pencil, `724:403` album) but splits them on
 * the 402 frame: the three DOCUMENT rows are 24 (`1297:1486`, `1297:1495`, `1297:1504`) and the
 * three CONSENT rows are 28 (`1297:1515`, `1297:1533`, `1297:1551`). A flat `size-10` was the
 * 1440 figure on both, i.e. a 40px mark in a row Figma draws 112 tall holding a 40-tall block.
 *
 * The gap goes with it: 8 on the phone frame (`1297:1486` ends at 24, `1297:1488` starts at 32)
 * against 16 at 1440 (`708:1995` ends at 52, `708:1997` starts at 68) — `sm:gap-4` unchanged.
