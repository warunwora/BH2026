/**
 * Figma 1423:2621 "COMING SOON" — a standalone splash page, off the nav/footer chrome the
 * way `NotFound.tsx` is (see the route table in `App.tsx`).
 *
 * Figma draws it twice: a 1440x1024 board (1419:495) and a 402x874 phone board (1419:496).
 * Each is the same five things — four corner decorations, a sponsor logo row, the painted
 * "COMING S🦐ON", and two blocks of copy — but the two boards are re-laid-out rather than
 * scaled, and their word art differs (one line across at 1440, stacked over two on the
 * phone), so both sets of art are shipped and swapped at `lg`.
 *
 * The decorations are flattened PNGs rather than transcribed node-by-node. Every other
 * decoration file here (HomeBackground, AboutDecor, …) transcribes because its art is
 * shared across pages and has to be re-composed per breakpoint; this page's art appears
 * nowhere else and is four rigid clusters, so an export is byte-exact for free. Verified:
 * composited against Figma's own 1440x1024 render, all four pieces plus the logo row
 * cross-correlate to an offset of exactly (0, 0).
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ why the corners anchor
 *
 * Figma pins each decoration at a page x/y on its board, and reading those literally — a
 * fixed 1440x1024 stage, centred — is what the first pass did. That is only the design at
 * exactly 1440x1024. Anywhere else the stage is not the viewport, so the art stops short of
 * the screen: at 1920 the napkins ended 240px inside both edges with white beyond them, and
 * on any window taller than 1024 the pasta floated above the bottom. The art is drawn to
 * BLEED — every one of the four runs off the board it is pinned to (the right napkin by 330,
 * the bottom-right pasta by 525 across and 274 down) — so what the geometry actually says is
 * "this piece belongs to that corner, hanging off it by this much".
 *
 * So each piece is stated as an offset from the corner it owns, and the pair of numbers per
 * piece below is exactly that: Figma's own box, re-expressed against the near corner instead
 * of against the board's origin. At 1440x1024 the two readings are the same drawing; away
 * from it the corner reading is the one that keeps a napkin in the top-right of the SCREEN.
 */

/*
 * WebP, and the one place on the site that uses it. These twelve exports are 4.3MB as PNG
 * and 1.6MB as WebP with the art at q94 (mean error under 1/255 composited over white) and
 * the two logo rows LOSSLESS — those carry 11px type, "Faculty of Engineering", which is the
 * one thing here a lossy encoder would visibly soften. Worth the exception: this is a splash
 * page, so its art IS the page, and there is no second screen to amortise a 4MB first paint
 * over. Every browser this codebase already requires — it uses CSS `atan2()`, `dvh` and view
 * transitions — has supported WebP for years, so no PNG fallback is carried.

 * down). Keeping the margin rather than trimming to the ink is what lets these numbers stay
 * Figma's own, so the geometry can be checked against the file without a second table of
 * crop offsets in between.
 *
 * Exactly one of `left`/`right` and one of `top`/`bottom` is set: that pair names the corner.

/**
 * How big a board's px is on this viewport.
 *
 * `tan(atan2(a, b))` is how this codebase divides a length by a length — calc() will not,
 * but atan2 takes two lengths and returns an angle and tan turns it back into the plain
 * ratio a/b. Same trick as `--decor-fit` in styles/pasta-motion.css.
 *
 * It takes the SMALLER of the width and height ratios, which is the part that keeps the
 * page readable rather than merely proportional. Width alone is the obvious reading and is
 * wrong on a short window: a 1440x680 laptop would draw the art at full size into two thirds
 * of the height it was drawn for, and the bottom pasta would climb into the copy. Taking the
 * height ratio there (0.66) shrinks the art instead and leaves the middle clear.
 *
 * The ceilings stop an ultrawide screen scaling a napkin past the point where it reads as a
 * napkin. The floors are deliberately low — low enough that they effectively never bind —
 * because a floor here does the opposite of what it looks like it does: it is only ever
 * reached on a window ALREADY too cramped for the art, and holding the pieces up at that
 * point pushes them inward off their corners and into the copy. Measured at 1440x620, where
 * the ratio asks for 0.605: a 0.7 floor put the bottom-left pasta's ink 17px over the second
 * line of the address. Letting it fall to 0.605 pulls the same ink back to x 195 against a
 * copy edge at 208, and the corner still reads.
