/**
 * Figma 708:1242-1249 "Decoration / Shrimp", the eight children of frame 1297:2115 "Shrimp" —
 * eight copies of ONE shrimp (all eight share the same image fill, hence the one PNG above)
 * ringed around the centre. Coordinates are relative to 1297:2115's own box so the whole
 * cluster can be dropped in at 1440 scale or shrunk for narrow screens.
 *
 * `[left, top, boxSize, rotate]`, straight off Figma's codegen for 1297:2115, node by node:
 * 708:1242 -> 708:1249 in table order. The image inside every box is 194.776 square and the
 * box is that square's bounding box once rotated — 194.776 * (|cos| + |sin|), which is why no
 * two boxes are the same size even though no two shrimp differ.
 *
 * Note `get_metadata` reports a DIFFERENT x/y for these same nodes (708:1242 at 447.701,
 * 245.318 rather than 193.85, 64.92): that tool gives the rotated node's own corner, codegen
 * gives the bounding box's top-left. The second is the one that means `left`/`top` in CSS.
