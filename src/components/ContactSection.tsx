/**
 * Both social glyphs are multi-layer Figma components, so each layer keeps the inset
 * Figma gives it inside a fixed box rather than being flattened into one file.
 *
 * -------------------------------------------------------- the badge, solved through 402
 *
 * `size` is a two-anchor `ramp()` in px, and it used to be a percentage of the icon box —
 * 65% for Facebook, 60% for Instagram, read as "52 of the 1440 frame's 80 box". A fraction
 * is the right instinct and the wrong number, because Figma does not scale these two glyphs
 * by the same factor as the box: the PAD is what it holds roughly constant.
 *
 *              box   glyph   pad    fraction
 *   402  fb     40    24      8      60%     `1190:938` / `1190:939`
 *        ig     40    24      8      60%     `1190:942` / `1190:943`
 *  1440  fb     80    52     14      65%     `708:454`  / `708:455`
 *        ig     80    48     16      60%     `708:458`  / `708:459`
 *
 * So Facebook's fraction is NOT one number (60% at 402, 65% at 1440) — 65% of the phone's
 * 40 box is 26, two px over Figma's 24 — and Instagram's happens to be. Both are written as
 * px ramps through their own two anchors instead, which is also proof against the failure
 * the percentages had: a percentage only resolves against the box if every ancestor keeps a
 * definite size, and each of these badges is a fixed box holding absolutely-inset layers.
 * `ramp(24, 52)` and `ramp(24, 48)` are 52.000 and 48.000 at `--fl` = 1 — 1440 unchanged.

 * The two rows' destinations are the SAME two URLs the footer and the team dashboard use, out

 * channels' own names ("BangMod Hackathon" is the Facebook page, "bangmodhack.kmutt" the
 * Instagram handle) and `SOCIAL_LINKS` is in that order, so the pairing is by index rather
 * than by a second copy of the URLs. `target="_blank"` + `rel="noopener noreferrer"` matches

               * 187 on the phone, bottom 164 of 344 at 1440).
               *

               * stopping at 155 of 344 — and that is a correction toward the design, not a
               * regression. It is also what let the masked scrim below be deleted outright.

               *
               * Both were 0.45 / 0.6 originally. The tint at 0.45 was genuinely wrong — it
               * covered only the bottom 45% of a 187-tall band while the address plate is the
               * bottom 151 of that same band, so the title and the pin sat on bare sunlit
               * photograph and the copy read as mush. Raising the TINT to 1 fixed that.
               *
               * Raising the BLUR to 1 along with it did not fix anything and broke the picture:
               * at 1 the softening runs the band's full 344, i.e. the bottom 57% of the 600 map,
               * so more than half the building dissolved. Figma keeps the photograph sharp and
               * only breathes at its lower edge. 0.6 of the band is 206px — about 34% of the map
               * — which is what the frame shows.
               *
               * The two are independent on purpose: the tint's job is legibility (it must reach
               * the whole plate), the blur's job is to soften an edge (it must not eat the
               * subject). One number could never serve both.
