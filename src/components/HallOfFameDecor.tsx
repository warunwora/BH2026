 * it is NOT the 1440 ring at `--decor-fit`. Its "Pan" frame is 230.0009 x 215 at frame
 * (250, -42) inside "Hero / Title & Description" (1190:1471, y 131), i.e. page (250, 89) —
 * a ring 230 across, tucked against the right edge beside the title.
 *
 * What the 1440 stage was doing at 402 instead, which is the bug reported ("a grey pan ring
 * behind the top-left of the nav, oversized and in the wrong place"): `w-[1754px]` scaled by
 * 100vw/1440 = 0.279 is 489.4 wide, and `right: calc(-314px * fit)` puts its right edge at
 * 402 + 87.6, so the frame spanned x 0.2..489.6 — the plate landed at 280..490 and the pans
 * at 264..465, twice Figma's size and starting under the nav pill instead of beside the title.
 *
 * The nine pans are the desktop nine at a uniform 0.37716 (art 125.851 x 89.494 against the
 * desktop 333.685 x 237.287; the plate is 284 x 179 against 749 x 474, 0.3792) in the same
 * paint order with the same nine angles — 39.38, 78.77, 118.15, 157.9, -162.35, -122.59,
 * -82.84, -43.09, -3.34 — so this is the same ring re-laid-out, not a second design. Figma's
 * frame does NOT clip (its pans run x -7.5..271.5 and y -35..249.6 inside a 230x215 box and
 * the render shows all of them); the page frame's own 402 edge is the only crop, which here is
 * the page root's `overflow-x-clip`.
 *
 * Boxes are `get_design_context`'s, i.e. the bbox directly — not `get_metadata`'s rotated
 * corner. Coordinates are relative to the 230.0009 x 215 frame.

     * `overflow-clip`, not `overflow-hidden`. The stage is a flat 1440 centred in the band, so
     * below 1440 it hangs off BOTH sides — and the right-hand overhang is scrollable under
     * `hidden`, which made the red band itself pannable by a touch drag (136px at 375).
     * Exactly the bug the `html` note in index.css describes, inside one element.
     *
     * `--hof-scale` used to be set inline here, because index.css stepped it 0.45 / 0.7 /
     * max(1, 100vw/1440) at 768 and 1024 and the two flat steps each left WHITE GUTTERS over
     * the top of their band. It is now `max(0.45, tan(atan2(100vw, 1440px)))` in `.hof-band`
     * itself, which is all three steps at once and none of the seams — never below 100vw/1440
     * so the art always covers the viewport, floored at the 0.4496 Figma's own phone band is
     * drawn at (`1190:1606`'s wave is 1502.87 of the 3342.99 on `1297:224`), and byte-identical
     * to the old rule from 1440 up. The inline is deleted rather than kept: an inline
     * declaration outranks a stylesheet one, so it was forcing the sheet's `@supports not
     * (scale: tan(...))` fallback to carry an `!important` purely to beat it.
