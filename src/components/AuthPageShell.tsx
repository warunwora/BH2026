/**
 * Figma 708:1174 / 708:2022 / 708:2260 — the colour-block page shared by the
 * registration gate and the success/error results. Unlike sign-in these frames carry
 * no food decoration at all, just the three page-filling blocks.
 *
 * The 900 column is Figma's `left-[270px] right-[270px]` inset of the 1440 frame, and
 * its top row sits at 60. Cards are bottom-open (`rounded-t-[32px]`) and run to the
 * fold, so they stretch rather than carrying a fixed 850 height.
 *
 * THE KNOWN DIVERGENCE THAT USED TO BE RECORDED HERE IS RESOLVED. This shell put a bare white
 * "‹ หน้าหลัก" link straight on the colour blocks where Figma draws a white PLATE carrying the
 * wordmark and the account chip — `1239:947` (402) / `1239:957` (1440) on the gate, `1297:427` /
 * `1297:603` / `1297:556` on the results — and no back link at all. It now renders the same
 * `AuthTopBar` the wizard does, which is what `auth-topbar` was always claiming: the corner is
 * ONE object the browser carries from the gate through every step to the result, not two
 * different rows that crossfade into each other.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ the page does not scroll
 *
 * Both Figma anchors fit the frame exactly and set `clipsContent: true` — `1214:127` is
 * 402x874 (24 + 80 + 24 + 722 + 24) and `708:1174` is 1440x1024 (60 + 92 + 40 + 832). The
 * document is not meant to scroll on these screens; the requirement list inside the card is.
 * So the shell is `h-dvh`, exactly the viewport rather than at least it, and the column below
 * is `min-h-0 flex-1` so a child can be told to shrink.
 *
 * The column also carries the scrollport as a floor, and the axes are named separately on
 * purpose: `overflow-y-auto` alone would compute `overflow-x` to `auto` as well and hand the
 * page a sideways pan, which is the one thing that must never happen here.
 * `overflow-x-clip` pins it shut. When the children fit — which is every anchor — neither axis
 * scrolls and there is no scrollbar to see; when a viewport is genuinely too short for a card
 * that has not yet been given its own scrollport, the CONTENT scrolls and the document still
 * does not.

 *
 * Both sizes are two-anchor ramps now rather than a `lg:` pair: `1297:449` draws this pill
 * 49 tall on the 402 frame, 60 at 1440. Held at the desktop 60 from 1024 up it was the one
 * control on the result screen that did not track the card around it.
 *
 * The LABEL is a measured ramp, not `fl-20`. `1297:450` is 16 and `708:2034` is 20, and the
 * PHONE FRAME WINS on size — the rank's 17 floor used to override the 16 Figma actually draws,
 * which is a step too big on the frame that has the least room for it. The ceiling is unchanged
 * at 20.000, so 1440 does not move. `font-semibold` is 600 at both anchors, stated once.
 *
 * The RADIUS was `rounded-[20px]`, i.e. the 1440 value flat, where `1297:449` draws 16 against
 * `708:2031`'s 20.
 *
 * The icon gap ramps with the glyph SuccessStep hangs in it: 16 on `1297:568`'s row, 20 on

/**
 * The success/error card: a 302 illustration, a centred message and one full-width
 * action, all centred in the 850-tall card.
 *
 * `auth-result`, NOT `auth-sheet`, and the change is the fix for the reported submit
 * transition — the one where the colour blocks painted over the outgoing page and this card's
 * action pill sat in the top-left corner of the screen before snapping down into place.
 *
 * Sharing `auth-sheet` with the wizard's form card made the submit hop a MORPH between the
 * two, and `::view-transition-new` is laid into the group's box top-aligned at
 * `inline-size: 100%` — so for the length of that morph this card was drawn anchored to the
 * outgoing form card's top edge, which on a scrolled phone starts ~560px above the viewport.
 * Its last child, the action, therefore started near y=0. Under its own name the card's group
 * is pinned (styles/auth-motion.css) and the snapshot is drawn at exactly its own box, so
 * nothing inside it is displaced at any frame; the plate is presented off the bottom edge
 * instead, on the same spring the gate's sheet arrives on.
 *
 * THE OVERLAP REPORT WAS NOT FULLY CLOSED BY THAT CHANGE, and the remainder is not in this file.
 * Dropping `view-transition-name` off the colour blocks put them back in `::view-transition-*(root)`
 * — the bottom group — which is correct, but the ground still finished changing while the outgoing
 * form was still on screen. Measured on the frozen hop (submit, 402 and 1440): `::view-transition-
 * old(auth-sheet)` and `old(wizard-body)` fade over 200ms while `old/new(root)` cross-fade over
 * 360ms from t=0, so at t=80 the terms step sits at opacity 0.6 over a ground that is already 22%
 * of the way to the result page — three colour fills legible straight through a half-transparent
 * white plate. Visually identical to the original complaint; a different cause. The fix is to
 * serialise the two in styles/auth-motion.css (a 180ms `animation-delay` on the submit hop's root
 * pair, and the result plate's present pushed to 240ms) — see the report for the exact rules.
 *
 * `data-auth-entrance` is gated on `useOwnArrival()`, which is the same guard the gate's sheet
 * spring takes. Through a transition the plate's own arrival carries the screen and the
 * children below must hold still: a 640ms present travelling the plate's whole height with a
 * 48px/14px cascade running inside it is two motions on one object. On a direct load or a
 * reload there is no present, and the cascade is what makes the screen arrive.

       * TWO CHANGES HERE, both forced by the top row becoming Figma's 80/92 plate.
       *
       * The GAP above the card was 24 @402 → 70 @1440, where the 70 had been measured from the
       * old bare link row. Against the plate it is 26: `1297:556` ends at y=152 and `708:2026` /
       * `708:2264` (the success and error cards, 900x850) start at y=178. So the ramp is
       * 24 → 26 — exact at both ends, and a real correction of a mismatch rather than a
       * re-anchoring, hence the node ids.
       *
       * The 722 → 850 min-height is GONE, and dropping it is what makes the numbers land. The
       * shell is now exactly the viewport, so `flex-1` alone resolves the card to whatever is
       * left: 874 - 24 - 80 - 24 - 24 = 722 at 402, which is `1297:436` to the pixel, and
       * 1024 - 60 - 92 - 26 = 846 at 1440. Figma's own 850 overflows its 1024 frame by 4 — the
       * card is bottom-open and drawn past the fold — so 846 is the honest reading of a card
       * that runs to the bottom edge. A floor taller than the space available would have put a
       * 4px scrollbar on the column at exactly 1440. On a viewport genuinely too short for the
       * contents the flex item's own content minimum takes over, the card grows, and the column
       * scrolls it — the content moves, never the document.
       *
       * Three more lengths measured off the same two nodes, all of which were the 1440 value
       * held flat:
       *
       *   gap       32 `1297:436` → 40 `708:2026`   (`gap-10` was the ceiling)
       *   padding   the uniform ramp SPLITS: `1297:436` is 40 on top with 24 on the other
       *             three sides, where `708:2026` is 40 all round. So `pt-10` is FLAT — Figma
       *             gives the phone card the same 40 above the mascot as the desktop one, and
       *             the old single ramp was putting 24 there — and only px / pb ramp 24 → 40.
       *
       * ------------------------------------------------------------- the RADIUS is not a ramp
       *
       * It was written as one — `rounded-t-[…20 → 32]` — and that is wrong on the phone, which
       * is what the user saw: square bottom corners under round top ones. The two frames do not
       * differ by a number here, they differ in SHAPE:
       *
       *   `1297:436`  `cornerRadius: 20`                — all four corners
       *   `708:2026`  `rectangleCornerRadii: [32,32,0,0]` — top two only
       *
       * The desktop card is bottom-open because it runs past the fold; the phone card is a
       * closed card sitting 24 above the frame's bottom edge. So the radius ramps 20 → 32 on
       * the TOP pair and, on the bottom pair, is 20 below `md` and 0 from `md` up. A single
       * `rounded-t-` could never express that — it left the phone's bottom corners at 0.
