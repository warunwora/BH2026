     *
     * `About.tsx`'s page root carries `isolate`, which creates a stacking context. A z-index
     * only ever competes INSIDE its own context, so the sheet's 60 was being compared with its
     * siblings on the page and the whole context was then placed under the nav's 50 in the root.
     * Measured: with the sheet open, `elementFromPoint` at the nav pill's centre still returned
     * a nav link. No z-index on the sheet can win that, because the number is not the problem.
     *
     * A portal moves the DOM node to `<body>`, so the sheet is a sibling of the nav in the root
     * context and the 60 finally means what it says. It also makes the sheet immune to any
     * future ancestor growing a transform, filter or `contain` — the same trap, one refactor
     * away. React keeps the portal in the component tree, so state, context and the Escape
     * handler are unaffected.
