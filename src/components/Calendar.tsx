 * `1235:81` / `1235:84` — `calendar_add_regular`. This replaced `add_circle_dash_light` (a
 * dashed ring around a plus) when the label was retyped; the glyph is now a calendar leaf
 * with a plus, so it is a different drawing and not a re-export of the same one.
 *
 * Figma boxes it 36x36 `overflow-clip` and insets the vector rather than exporting it at the
 * box's size — the SVG is 28.49 square — so the `<img>` needs that inset to land at the size
 * the design draws. Painting the asset straight into a 36 box, which is what the old
 * full-bleed export allowed, would scale the glyph up by 36/28.49 and crop its plus.

/**
 * The row splits 700 / 476 inside the 1200 content column — expressed as grid `fr`
 * columns, because flex ratios round the split a few px off at this size.
 * `bowl` is where the spaghetti photo starts inside each card: the same 834-wide
 * image, pushed right in the wide card and pulled far left in the narrow one, so both
 * cards show a different slice of the same bowl.
 */
/*
 * `bowl` is the photo's geometry, and it is a two-composition problem.
 *
 * From `md` the row exists, so Figma's slice is reproducible: the 834-wide image is
 * re-expressed as a percentage of the card it sits in — 834.211/700 for the wide card
 * (708:171 in 708:162), 834.211/476 for the narrow one (708:180 in 708:172) — with `left` as
 * the same percentage of the card. That scales the whole bowl with the column and shows the
 * identical slice at any width from 768 up, where the hard 834px only showed the correct one
 * at exactly 1440.
 *
 * `md` and not `lg`, which is where this switch used to sit. Both slices are stated as
 * percentages of the card, and from 768 up the card is Figma's ROW card — a landscape box
 * beside its sibling — so the desktop slice is the one whose geometry the box has. Reading
 * the phone slice into it left the 768-1023 band with a tilted plate hung in the top third of
 * a card the desktop slice fills, and jumped the whole plate at 1024.
 *
 * Below `md` the phone frame specifies the slice, so the old corner-garnish invention
 * (two thirds of the card wide, hung off the bottom-right) is gone. 1190:604 / 1190:613
 * put the SAME 834:441 plate in the 354-wide card at 376.267 wide — 106.29% of the card,
 * so it overflows the right edge and is clipped by it — and tilt it. Figma reports the
 * rotated bounding boxes; the numbers below are their centres taken back to the unrotated
 * box, which is what CSS positions before it transforms:
 *
 *   red    bbox (132.33, -5.39) 399.607x247.784 @ -7.73deg  -> box (144, 19.01)
 *   yellow bbox (145.63,  2.09) 393.003x232.826 @ 174.71deg -> box (154, 19.00)
 *
 * as fractions of the 354x200 card: left 40.678% / 43.503%, top 9.505%.

 * ---------------------------------------------------- the highlight row's own split
 *
 * Figma's row is 700 / 476 inside the 1200 column: 708:162 is x0 w700, 708:172 is x724 w476,
 * so the gap is 24 and the three add to 1200 exactly. The phone frame has no row at all
 * (1190:594 is one stack of five), so the split only exists from `md`.
 *
 * It used to be `md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-[700fr_476fr]` — an even split for the whole
 * tablet band and then Figma's at 1024. Both halves are defensible on their own and the pair
 * is not: the proportion of the row is part of the composition, and jumping it 9.5 points at
 * one breakpoint is exactly the thing this page interpolates everywhere else. So the ratio
 * ramps, solved through both of its anchors the way every size in this repo is:
 *
 *     768   0.5        an even split. The narrow card carries `23 ก.ย.` plus a 37-character
 *                      label, and at 768 Figma's ratio would leave it 258 wide — narrower
 *                      than the 354 the PHONE gives it. So the row's low anchor is the
 *                      widest the narrow card can be, not a Figma number.
 *    1440   700/1176   = 0.5952381, Figma's own (708:162 / 708:172 above).
 *
 * `--fl` is a *length* (0px at 375, 1px at 1440), and a track fraction has to be a plain
 * number, so it is read back out with `tan(atan2(--fl, 1px))` — the same trick index.css
 * uses for `.hof-band`, since calc() will not divide a length by a length. At `--fl` = 1 the
 * ramp is 0.5952381 and the left track resolves to (1200 - 24) * 0.5952381 = 700.000, i.e.
 * Figma's number to a ten-thousandth of a pixel; the right track is `1fr`, so it takes the
 * remaining 476. Above 1440 `--fl` freezes and the column caps at 1200, so the split holds.
 *
 * `--hl-gap` restates STACK_GAP because the left track has to subtract the gap the row is
 * already carrying; the two must stay equal.
 *
 * `hl-row` on the element below is a HOOK, not a style — nothing in this file's stylesheets
 * sets it. The `tan(atan2(...))` above embeds a `var()`, so `grid-template-columns` PARSES on
 * a browser without CSS trig and only fails at computed-value time, where it resets to
 * `none` and the two cards stack from `md` up instead of forming Figma's 700/476 row. A
 * fallback therefore cannot be an earlier declaration in the same rule; it has to be a
 * separate `@supports not (...)` block, which index.css carries against this class. It beats
 * the Tailwind utility below because an unlayered rule outranks anything in `@layer`.
