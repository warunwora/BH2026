/**
 * The upload toast — Figma 1359:1024 (uploading), 1359:1142 (paused), 1359:1117 (success),
 * 1359:1161 (failed) and 1359:1185 (refused) — and the viewport that stacks them.
 *
 * ============================================================== the two anchors, and Figma's
 *
 * All five frames are 368 wide, and there is no narrow variant of any of them in the file.
 * So there is exactly ONE anchor here: the 1440 column. Every number below that came from
 * Figma is that anchor's, and where a second anchor was needed it was CHOSEN, not read —
 * each choice is written out where it is made. That is a deliberate departure from the rest
 * of this codebase, where every `calc(MIN + DELTA * var(--fl))` has a measured frame at both
 * ends; inventing a phone frame's geometry would be worse than saying so.
 *
 * What is held flat at Figma's value, and why each is safe on a 402 viewport:
 *
 *   radius 12                    the frame's `cornerRadius`. Same 12 the fields land on at
 *                                1440 (Field.tsx's FIELD_SHAPE), and a floating card is not
 *                                a control the thumb has to fit inside.
 *   padding 10                   1359:1024's `paddingLeft/Top/Right/Bottom`. Already smaller
 *                                than the 8 the phone's own controls use.
 *   gaps 12 / 4 / 8              icon→text (1359:1208), reason→dot→size (1359:1100),
 *                                action→dismiss (1359:1116).
 *   ring 32, glyph 20, stroke 1  1359:1095 and its four siblings.
 *   action 28, its glyph 20      1359:1115.
 *   bar 6 tall on a 100 radius   1359:1205.
 *
 * What is NOT held flat is the card's WIDTH, because 368 in a 402 viewport leaves 17px of
 * gutter on each side and reads as a desktop card that happens to have shrunk. Below `md` the
 * card is full width inside a 12px inset (378 at 402, within 10px of Figma's own 368) and
 * from `md` up it is Figma's 368 exactly.
 *
 * Type is the repo's ladder rather than a new ramp, and it lands on Figma's numbers at 1440:
 * the title is 14/500 on a 21.154 line (1359:1030) → `fl-14` (14 at both ends) at
 * `leading-[1.511]`, and the status line is 12/400 on 18.132 (1359:1099, 1359:1101) →
 * `fl-12` at the same 1.511. Weight is never ramped and there is only one anchor to match, so
 * there is no breakpoint on it: `font-medium` on the title, normal on the status line.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- the one addition
 *
 * None of the five frames carries an `effects` entry, i.e. Figma draws no shadow. A card that
 * floats over a live form with no shadow at all does not read as floating — it reads as
 * pasted into the page — so a restrained two-stop shadow in the card's own ink is added here.
 * It is the only value on this component that is not from Figma, and it is called out in the
 * report rather than buried.

       * than a flex `gap`, because a `gap` does not collapse with its item and would leave

       *
       * Rendered in every state, not just the two that show it — an element that is only

       *
       * THREE elements, and the middle one is a FIX rather than a wrapper for its own sake.
       *
       * `min-h-0` on the row is necessary — this element is a flex item of the card's column,
       * where `min-height: auto` would floor it at its own min-content height — but it was not
       * SUFFICIENT, and the difference was measured: at 375 a settled card was 71.27 tall with

       * 6 of the 18 the note above claims.
       *
       * The floor was the grid ITEM's own `padding-top`. `min-height: 0` (toast.css,
       * `.toast-progress > *`) zeroes the item's CONTENT box; its padding still contributes to
       * the border-box minimum, so a `0fr` track containing a 12px-padded item resolves to
       * 12px, not 0. Proven both ways in the browser: clearing that padding took the track to
       * `0px` and the card to 59.27, and moving it onto an inner element did the same while
       * leaving the open row at `18px` / 77.27.
       *
       * So the grid item now carries nothing but the box, and the 12 gap lives one level in.
       * It still belongs INSIDE the collapsing row rather than on the card's flex `gap`, for
       * the reason the note above gives — a `gap` does not collapse with its item — and the
       * row's `overflow: clip` is what hides the padded child while the track is at 0.

/**
 * The region the cards live in.
 *
 * POSITION. Below `md` the stack hangs from the TOP edge, full width inside a 12px inset;
 * from `md` up it is a bottom-right corner card at Figma's 368. Neither is in the file — no
 * frame in this set places a toast on a screen — so both were chosen, on two grounds:
 *
 *  - the keyboard. Every one of these toasts is raised from a form that has text fields above
 *    and below the upload box. A bottom-anchored toast on a phone sits exactly where the
 *    software keyboard opens, and a success message that is only visible when nothing is
 *    focused is not a message. The top edge is never occluded.
 *  - the nav. `.site-nav-band` is `fixed top-0` at `clamp(92px, 6.5510597vw + 65.6647399px,
 *    160px)` (Navbar.tsx), so the top inset is that same expression plus 12 — the toast clears
 *    the blur band at every width rather than at one. The wizard routes have no navbar, where
 *    the offset simply reads as headroom.
 *
 * The card ARRIVES FROM the edge it is anchored to and LEAVES the same way — `--toast-enter-y`
 * in toast.css is negative below `md` and positive above it, and the exit is the entrance
 * played backwards. That symmetry is the whole reason a dismiss feels like the inverse of an
 * arrival rather than a separate event.
 *
 * NO SIDEWAYS PAN. `inset-x-0` is `left: 0; right: 0`, which cannot exceed the viewport, and
 * every transform in play is on the Y axis only, so nothing here can widen the document. No
 * `overflow` is set because nothing overflows horizontally; no `contain`, `isolation`,
 * `filter` or ancestor `opacity` is set either, and the element is portalled to `<body>` so it
 * is not an ancestor of `.site-nav-band` in the first place — the nav's progressive blur is
 * untouched by construction.
 *
 * PAUSE ON HOVER. A pointer resting on the stack, or focus landing inside it, stops every
 * timer — all of them, not just the card under the cursor, because a column that dissolves
 * from underneath the one you are reading is the failure this is for. Keyboard users get the
 * same via focus capture, and a backgrounded tab gets it via `visibilitychange` in the
 * provider, so a toast cannot expire while nobody is looking at it.
