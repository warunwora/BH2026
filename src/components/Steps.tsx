 * `<img>` as custom properties so a single element can carry both and let `md:` choose;
 * pinning one of them inline would have made it unbeatable by the other.
 *
 * The choice is made at `md` and not at `lg`, which is where it used to sit. `md` is where
 * Figma's two-up row starts to exist (1190:630 stacks the same three cards below it), so it
 * is also where the card stops being the phone's full-width block and becomes the desktop
 * row's half-column: 318 wide at 768 against desktop's 588, i.e. 0.54 of it where the
 * viewport is 0.533 of 1440. The plate that box wants is the 540x200 one. Left at `lg` the
 * 768-1023 band drew the phone's taller 322x160 plate with the phone's tighter photo fan and
 * then re-pinned all four photos at 1024.

     *
     * ------------------------------------------------- the "02" that vanishes at 1440
     *
     * Known bug, NOT fixable from this file, measured at 1440 so the next reader does not have
     * to re-derive it:
     *
     *   - the "02" eyebrow's glyph box lands at page y 2540..2554.
     *   - `GARLIC_LEFT` (HomeBackground.tsx) is pinned at Figma page y 2184.068 and is 363.932
     *     tall, so its yellow wave's bottom edge is at 2548.0.
     *   - that wave is `#D79A4E`, byte-for-byte `--color-brand-yellow`, which is the eyebrow's
     *     own colour (Figma 708:195 confirms #d79a4e). The top 8px of the digits are therefore
     *     drawn in the wave's colour on the wave and the number reads as half-eaten.
     *
     * It is not a stacking bug and cannot be fixed by raising one: the column below is already
     * `relative z-10` against a canvas that is `-z-10` inside the page wrapper's `isolate`, so
     * the number IS painted on top — it just has nothing to contrast with. Nor is it a colour
     * bug: Figma's own render of 708:39 has the garlic wave ending well clear of the heading,
     * with the header at y2588 to the wave's 2548 — 40px of cream between them.
     *
     * The live page is 48px short of that 2588, which is the whole of the defect. Fixing it by
     * padding this section is what a first pass would reach for and is wrong: the Prizes
     * content is currently 18.5px ABOVE its Figma y (live "03" at 3890, Figma 708:267 at
     * 3908.5) while the red band it sits on is canvas-anchored and would not move with it, so
     * +48 here buys a legible "02" at the price of dropping Prizes 30px off its own band.
     *
     * The fix belongs to the decoration, not to the rhythm: HomeBackground.tsx GARLIC_LEFT.y
     * 2184.068 -> 2136.068. -48 puts the wave's bottom at 2500, restores Figma's exact 40px of
     * clearance above the live header, and reflows nothing — the calendar's tail is empty page
     * from ~2050 down to this header, so the group has the room to move up into.
