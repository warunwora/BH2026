       * and the UA reduces overlapping radii proportionally, so `100px` on a 72-tall box RENDERS
       * as exactly 36. Declaring the rendered value is what keeps the interpolation monotone —
       * tweening 100 → 24 while the height goes 72 → 303 raises the clamp ceiling faster than
       * the radius falls, and the corners visibly balloon to ~62 halfway through before coming
       * back. `md:rounded-[100px]` pins the desktop pill to its existing declaration, so nothing
       * at or above 768 changes by a pixel either way.
       *
       * The radius TRANSITION is not declared here, deliberately. `.site-nav { transition: … }`
       * in micro-motion.css is UNLAYERED, and an unlayered declaration beats a layered one
       * whatever its specificity (that file documents the trap at length above `.mm-press`) —
       * and `transition` is a shorthand that replaces the whole list, so a
       * `transition-[border-radius]` utility here would be silently dropped rather than merged.
       * `border-radius` is therefore listed in that rule itself, alongside `box-shadow`, inside
       * the same `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference` guard. One source of truth for the

             * phone frame. `1341:338` is its 24x24 `close_regular` counterpart, so the open
             * state has a Figma node now too; both are drawn as strokes below rather than
             * shipped as assets, which is what lets them take `currentColor` and rotate into
             * each other.
             *
             * The 44px box stays: it is the touch target, and the glyph inside is the 24 the
             * design draws. `-my-0.5` cancels the 4px the 44 box would otherwise add to a row
             * whose height Figma sets from the 40px logo, so the pill stays 72 tall. `-mr-2.5`
             * puts the glyph's own box at 322..346 inside the 362 pill — `1341:335`'s own x —
             * with the extra 10px of target hanging into the pill's padding; from `sm` up the
             * register button is beside it and the target goes back inside the padding box.
             *
             * States: `hover:text-brand-red` is the same tint the nav links take, so the glyph
             * is not the one control in the pill that ignores the pointer, and it is a colour
             * change so it survives reduced motion. `.mm-press-icon:active` is the press — 0.9
             * rather than 0.97, because 3% on a 24px mark does not register.

         * THE UNFOLD. This is the second half of the same white box, so the animation is the box
         * getting taller and nothing else — no separate panel arriving, no opacity or transform
         * anywhere on this element or above it. That last part is a hard constraint rather than a
         * preference: `.site-nav-band` is a sibling of the `<nav>` and its layered
         * `backdrop-filter` stack samples the page behind it, so an isolated group anywhere in
         * its ancestor chain (`opacity`, `filter`, `transform`, `contain`, `isolation`) turns it
         * into a backdrop root and the progressive blur does not weaken, it disappears. The
         * shell and the `<nav>` therefore stay clean and every moving property lives on the two
         * elements inside this subtree, which the band is not descended from. `overflow: clip`
         * is safe — it clips, it does not isolate.
         *
         * `grid-template-rows: 0fr → 1fr` is the repo's own collapse (micro-motion.css documents
         * it above `.mm-collapse`): the only way to transition to a CONTENT height, since `auto`
         * is not interpolable and a scaleY would squash the Thai text. The shared class is not
         * reused here because it also fades its single child at `--mm-base`, and this menu wants
         * the fade to be a per-item stagger *inside* the box rather than one wash over the whole
         * of it — the two would multiply. The tokens are the shared ones either way.
         *
         * The panel stays mounted so closing animates too; unmounting would make it snap shut.
         * At 0fr the wrapper is genuinely 0 tall — every length below (the two 22px gaps
         * included) is inside the track, which is what the old version got wrong: it had `p-6`
         * and `mt-3` OUTSIDE the 0fr row, `min-height: 0` collapses a grid item's content box
         * and not its padding, and the closed wrapper still measured 60px. That left a 402x60
         * transparent strip across the top of every phone page swallowing taps exactly where the
         * hero lockup begins (y151, `1190:672`). Nothing here has padding of its own, so there is
         * no strip to leave behind, and `inert` closes the remaining gap: it takes the subtree
         * out of the tab order AND makes it unclickable, so one attribute answers for both the
         * keyboard and the finger.
