/**
 * Figma's "Scroll Edge Effect" — progressive blur that fades content out at an edge.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT FIGMA ACTUALLY DRAWS, taken off the component rather than guessed
 *
 * `get_design_context` on the nav instance (`708:406`) and on a past-event card's instance
 * (`1297:133` desktop / `1190:1516` phone) returns the same two-box structure:
 *
 *   <div style="backdrop-filter: blur(var(--scroll-edge-effect-blur-radius, 5px))">   ← no fill
 *     <div style="backdrop-filter: blur(30px); background: #282828; opacity: .9;
 *                 mask-image: url(gradient.svg)" />
 *   </div>
 *
 * and the exported mask is, on every instance, the SAME two-stop linear gradient spanning
 * the WHOLE band — `708:406`'s is 1440x160 with black at y0 and alpha 0 at y160; the card's
 * is 280x400 with alpha 1 at y400 (the solid edge, since the card's effect is flipped) and
 * alpha 0 at y0. No easing. No early termination. That is the spec, and three of the four
 * things this file used to do fought it:
 *
 * - The ramp is the FULL height of the band, always, on both frames and on every instance.
 *   There is no depth cap in the design. The old `MAX_RADII` / `RELAX_PER_FL` pair cut the
 *   phone card's ramp to 220px of its 400px band — 55% — and since the eased tint below was
 *   already down to a tenth of its peak by the halfway point, the whole effect collapsed
 *   into the bottom ~120px and stopped. That is the "banded, abruptly-ending" bottom the
 *   review reported: not a hard line, but a dark blob with nothing after it, where Figma
 *   fades smoothly across the full 400 to the card's bottom edge.
 * - The alpha ramp is LINEAR. The old `a0 * (1 - t/reach)^2` was invented to stop the plate
 *   reading as fog; what it actually did was starve the middle of the band of tint (0.225
 *   where Figma has 0.45) while the blur underneath kept averaging the artwork's darks into
 *   its lights. A blur with too little plate over it is exactly a muddy mid-tone wash — the
 *   nav band's "smeared, not graduated" look. Figma's stronger linear plate is what turns
 *   the same blur into a clean white-to-clear graduation.
 * - The tint is neutral `#282828` / `#ffffff`, and it is now a TWO-stop gradient, which is
 *   what the exported SVG is. Both stops share their RGB, so premultiplied interpolation is
 *   exactly linear in alpha with no hue excursion possible; the seven hand-written stops it
 *   replaces were the only place a cast could have been introduced.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * HOW THE RAMP IS BUILT, and why it is a stack at all
 *
 * CSS has no variable-radius backdrop filter. Figma's own fallback is to crossfade ONE flat
 * 30px blur to sharp with a linear alpha — that is all the markup above does — and it looks
 * fine, but it is the crudest possible rendition: at mid-alpha you are looking at a sharp
 * image and a 30px-blurred copy of it superimposed. A short stack of radii does better:
 *
 * Each layer gets its own radius and a mask that is opaque from the solid edge out to its own
 * station, then ramps to transparent across the next-weaker layer's station. Layers are
 * painted weakest-first, so the strongest ends up on top covering the solid edge. Adjacent
 * radii differ by RATIO (1.6, i.e. under 2x) — bigger jumps make the crossfade itself visible
 * as a soft band — and each station sits at `1 - RATIO^-i`, so the radius falls LINEARLY down
 * the ramp even though the radii are a geometric series. That is the ramp Figma's progressive
 * blur draws.
 *
 * THE STACK ACCUMULATES, and that has to be paid for. `backdrop-filter` samples the backdrop
 * *root*, which includes every sibling already painted below — so a layer sitting over four
 * opaque layers blurs an already-blurred image. Gaussians compose in quadrature, so what the
 * eye sees at station i is `sqrt(sum of the squares of every radius still opaque there)`, not
 * that layer's own radius. Unpaid, that made the whole ramp `sqrt(1.638)` = 1.28x stronger
 * than `plateBlur` asked for, at every station — a uniformly over-blurred, muddier band.
 *
 * The fix is exact rather than fudged. Let `T_i` be the radius the eye should see at station
 * i and `r_i` the radius that layer actually carries; wanting `sum r_k^2 (k >= i) = T_i^2`
 * for every i means `r_i^2 = T_i^2 - T_(i+1)^2`, and the sum telescopes to `T_i^2` exactly.
 * Because `T_i` is geometric, `T_i^2 - T_(i+1)^2 = T_i^2 * (1 - RATIO^-2)`, so every layer
 * but the last carries the same constant COMPENSATE = sqrt(1 - RATIO^-2) times its target.
 * The last layer has nothing under it and carries its target unchanged. One constant, and
 * the accumulated radius is its Figma figure at every station.
 *
 * FIVE LAYERS, not the seven this used to have. With the accumulation compensated the ramp's
 * SHAPE is set by RATIO and the stations, not by the count — the count only decides where the
 * last layer's own blur crossfades to sharp. At N = 5 that is `RATIO^-4` = 15% of the peak at
 * 85% down the ramp: under 8px on the strongest instance in the app and under 4px on every
 * other one, which is below where a blur-to-sharp crossfade reads on a photograph. The two
 * layers it buys back are two `backdrop-filter` passes and two backdrop-root reads on a
 * component that is mounted up to a dozen times per page. (For scale: Figma itself gets away
 * with N = 1 and the full radius, so anything from about four up is strictly smoother than
 * the spec.)
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * NO OVERSIZE PAD — the previous fix for edge smearing was the cause of the current one
 *
 * `backdrop-filter` crops its sample to the element's own box and edge-duplicates outside it,
 * so a boundary row gets stretched inward by up to one radius. The obvious answer, and what
 * this file did, is to grow every layer `1.8 x its own radius` past the box on all four sides
 * and clip the lot, so the clamped boundary lands outside the visible area. That is right in
 * general and wrong for every call site here, because it assumes there is real content out
 * there to sample. There is not:
 *
 * - the nav, the wizard and the dashboard bands are `inset-x-0 top-0` on a fixed shell, so the
 *   pad reaches above the viewport and past both its sides, where the backdrop root paints
 *   nothing. Blurring premultiplied transparent black inward both darkens the layer and eats
 *   its alpha, in a band one radius wide up each side — the "odd darker smudge toward the
 *   bottom-right" of the nav band, showing at mid-band precisely because the eased tint had
 *   left too little plate there to hide it.
 * - a past-event card's band is `inset-x-0 bottom-0` inside the card, so the pad reaches
 *   BELOW and BESIDE the card, and what it samples is the page. That page colour, pulled a
 *   radius deep into the card's bottom edge under a near-opaque plate, is the purple/blue
 *   cast the review saw over a photograph that is itself warm at that edge.
 *
 * So the layers are `inset-0`. The residual clamp is then a duplication of the band's own
 * boundary row — the same thing `filter: blur()` on an image does at its own edges, and a
 * smooth extension of the content rather than a foreign one. It is also self-hiding, which is
 * the quiet reason Figma's single-layer version holds up: the clamp is strongest where the
 * radius is largest, the radius is largest at the solid edge, and the solid edge is exactly
 * where the tint plate is at 0.9. Toward the open edge the tint thins out, but so does the
 * radius, so there is less and less to hide. At the open edge itself the mask is 0 and the
 * question does not arise.
 *
 * Dropping the pad also drops `--p` from every stop: a mask stop is now just `f` of the
 * reach, measured from the design edge, because the mask box IS the design box.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TWO SIZES, BOTH CSS, BECAUSE BOTH HAVE TO TRACK THE BAND
 *
 * `plateBlur` and the caller's band height are both numbers read off a 1440 canvas. Both fixes
 * are written as CSS rather than resolved in JS, off `containerType: 'size'` on the root, so
 * `100cqh` IS the band's own height and nothing has to be measured.
 *
 * - `--r` is capped at `MAX_OF_BAND` of the band. A band shorter than a few radii cannot ramp
 *   at all: on a 46px band a 30px Gaussian is still most of what you see at its own station,
 *   and the whole thing paints as one flat slab. Because both terms of the radius carry the
 *   layer's strength, the cap rescales the WHOLE geometric series and the 1.6 step survives —
 *   and because the compensation telescopes, the accumulated peak comes out at exactly
 *   `min(fluid peak, MAX_OF_BAND x band)`, which is what that constant is documented to mean.
 * - `--r` also rides the same 375 → 1440 `--fl` track the type and gutters do, down to
 *   `NARROW` of the Figma figure. 30px is 2% of a 1440 canvas and 8% of a 390 one.
 *
 * The ramp's DEPTH is no longer capped, in radii or otherwise — see the first section. It is
 * `tintReach` / `blurReach` of the band and nothing else, and since the mask now reaches
 * alpha 0 exactly at that depth there is nothing left for a cap to protect against: an
 * over-tall band gets Figma's own ramp stretched over it, which is what Figma does (400 of a
 * 650 card) rather than a wash ending on a line.
 *
 * Props (unchanged API):
 * - `tone`  — white for light pages; ink for the "- Soft" variant over dark photography.
 * - `plateBlur` — the radius at the solid edge, i.e. the strength of the whole effect.
 * - `flip`  — solid edge at the bottom instead of the top.
 * - `maskAlpha` — the exported mask's own `fill-opacity`, where an instance overrides it; the
 *   layer's 0.9 is separate and always applies. Card and Contact instances carry 0.9 here.
 * - `tintReach` / `blurReach` — the fraction of the caller's box Figma's band actually covers,
 *   for the call sites whose box is taller than the instance (Contact's map plate).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TWO MEASUREMENT TRAPS, both of which have already cost a round of work
 *
 * - **Do not measure this in headless Chromium.** Headless rasterises through SwiftShader and
 *   gets `backdrop-filter` wrong above `deviceScaleFactor: 1`: at DSF 3 a masked stack reads
 *   as a flat ~225px edge spread across the whole top third of the band (a textbook slab) and
 *   a lone unmasked `backdrop-filter` is dropped entirely. Headed Chromium, which is what the
 *   reviewer's DevTools device mode uses, gives an identical ramp at DSF 1, 2, 2.75 and 3.
 * - **This is not a device-pixel problem.** The resolved radii, mask stops and layer boxes are
 *   byte-identical across DSF 1/2/3, `isMobile`, and playwright's iPhone 13 / Pixel 5
 *   descriptors; `container-type: size` resolves under all of them. It IS partly a Safari
 *   problem, which is why every `backdrop-filter` and every `mask-image` below is written
 *   twice, prefixed and unprefixed: Safari and every iOS browser still ship only
 *   `-webkit-backdrop-filter`, and without it the effect does not degrade there, it vanishes.
 *   (If Safari turns out not to include earlier siblings in the backdrop — the spec says it
 *   should — the compensation makes the ramp 22% weaker there rather than stronger, which is
 *   the safe direction to be wrong in.)

 * SAME blur figures as their 1440 counterparts: `1190:778` (the 402x92 nav band) and
 * `1190:1516` (the 280x400 phone past-event card). At 0.55 the phone nav peaked at 16.8px
 * where Figma implies 30, and the phone card got 27.5 where Figma says 30 — so the effect the
 * design draws as its strongest was arriving at just over half strength on exactly the screens
 * the user was looking at.
 *
 * The 0.55 came from a reasonable-sounding argument that did not survive being checked against
 * the file: "30px is 2% of a 1440 canvas and 8% of a 390 one", so scale it down. But the blur
 * is not a proportion of the canvas — it is a proportion of the BAND, and the band shrinks too
 * (160 → 92 on the nav). `MAX_OF_BAND` already guards the one case this was aimed at, a band
 * too short to ramp at all, and it does it against the real quantity.
 *
 * Kept as a named constant rather than deleted so the ramp below stays readable as a ramp, and
 * so re-narrowing is a one-line change if a phone ever reads as over-blurred.
