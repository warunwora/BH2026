         was given both columns and half their width to centre it. Six cards divide evenly by
         both column counts — 3x2 at `lg` (Figma's own `2074:2605`, a 1200x942 block of two
         373x451 rows 40 apart) and 2x3 at `md` — so there is no orphan to arrange and every

         where each is at its Figma anchor and the copy (216 tall in a 333 measure) sits
         inside the 250 floor. As a hard height it was the band that gave way: at 1024 the
         card was still 451 with a 161 band, so the 373x250 folder silhouette was stretched
         to 264x290 and the card read as a tall box rather than as a smaller copy of the

               * under `prefers-reduced-motion`, and movement is what it drops.

                  a 375 screen was the widest thing in a pill that has to stay on one line.

                    the "icon too big" report. An `<img>` is a REPLACED element: absolutely
                    positioned with all four insets set, `width: auto` resolves to the image's
                    INTRINSIC width and the over-constrained `right` is discarded outright
                    (CSS 2.1 §10.3.7). So the glyph painted at the asset's own
                    18.8109 x 24.9493 at EVERY width — a 25-tall arrow inside a box the ramp
                    had correctly narrowed to 20.03 at 402, standing beside a 16px label.
                    `max-w-none` had also removed the preflight `max-width: 100%` that would
                    otherwise have capped it, so nothing was left to bound it at all. A span is
                    a non-replaced box, so the inset genuinely sizes it and `size-full` makes
                    the image follow.

                    The insets stay percentages rather than becoming a second ramp: 55.32% wide
                    x 73.38% tall is the glyph's share of Figma's icon frame, and at the box's
                    34 ceiling that is exactly 18.8088 x 24.9492 — the asset drawn 1:1. 1440 is
                    therefore unmoved to within the 4th decimal (same top/left, same size), and
                    402 finally gets the 11.08 x 14.70 glyph the 20-box implies. */}

                  pill where the frame draws 246. The ramp below is 16.000 at 402 and lands on
                  19.000 at `--fl` = 1, i.e. exactly the `fl-body` ceiling the ladder had here,
                  so the 1440 pill is unchanged (24 + 34 + 20 + 205.58 + 36 = 319.58 as before).
                  It is spelled out rather than promoted to `fl-lead`, whose 21 ceiling would
                  have moved desktop. Measured against the font: at 16/700 the label is 173.12,

                  ceiling — the type ladder in index.css is calibrated against /register at
                  1440 and owns that end. */}
