/**
 * One card, revealing itself.
 *
 * D5 — the three of these used to be children of one `reveal-group` on the grid. That is
 * correct from `md` up, where they sit in a row and measured 0.43 of the viewport all three:
 * one trigger, one 70ms ladder. At 390 the grid is a single column and the same trigger fired
 * for cards whose tops were at 1.03 and 1.60 of the viewport — a screen below the fold, where
 * the animation is spent before it can be seen.
 *
 * Per-card reveals cover both, and the ladder survives the split because the stagger is
 * published as `--reveal-delay` (index.css) rather than as a `transition-delay` a group has
 * to own. In the row, the three triggers land in the same frame and the delays read exactly
 * as the group's did; in the column each card brings its own delay with it, which is a 70ms
 * lead-in rather than a queue.
 *
 * The delay is set inline and NOT as `transition-delay`, which is a list matching
 * `transition-property`: as a longhand it also postponed this card's own hover lift by up to
 * 140ms.

         There are three cards and the middle band is two columns wide, so the third
         sat alone in the left half of a row with 430px of nothing beside it. It is
         given both columns and half their width instead, which centres it and turns
         the row into a deliberate 2-over-1 rather than an orphan. Three columns would
         have been the other way out, but ScopeCardArt is pinned in absolute px
         against Figma's 373-wide card, so a 198-wide card would show only the left
         half of each doodle band — two-up at 768 is 315, which is close to the
         width the art is drawn for. */
