/**
 * ============================================================================================
 * THE COOKIE NOTICE — Figma `2074:3200`
 * ============================================================================================
 *
 * A 368x167 white card, radius 12, 10px padding, 12px gaps: a round red badge and a heading
 * over a body paragraph, then a full-width ยอมรับ button. Every size, weight, colour and radius
 * below is transcribed from that node, and the copy is its `characters` verbatim rather than the
 * brief's paraphrase — the two differ, and Figma wins.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ what is NOT built from it
 *
 * `2074:3200` carries three nodes with `visible: false`, which the REST API returns like any
 * other child and which are leftovers from whatever component this card was cloned out of: an
 * `Ellipse 1` (`2074:3209`), a `9.3 MB of 9.3 MB` caption (`2074:3210`) — both from an upload
 * row — and a whole `แชร์ไปยัง Instagram` button (`2074:3228`) that is 720px wide inside a 368px
 * frame. None are rendered here. The frame's own 167px height is the arithmetic proof they are
 * not meant to be: 10 + 101 + 12 + 34 + 10 = 167 accounts for the card exactly, with nothing
 * left for them.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- the one add
 *
 * Figma gives this card NO shadow and no border. Pinned over the site's own `#fefdfc` pages that
 * is a white card on a white ground with no edge at all, so it takes `--shadow-soft`
 * (index.css: `0 0 40px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.05)`) — which is not an invention but the exact shadow the
 * navbar and every other floating white surface on this site already carries. It is the smallest
 * change that makes the card an object rather than a hole.
 *
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- the sizing
 *
 * Figma has no phone frame for this node, and unlike a page section this card has no phone
 * behaviour to infer: it is a fixed-size widget, and its two type ranks are 14px and 12px, which
 * are already at the floor where Thai stays legible. A two-anchor ramp here would resolve to a
 * 402 anchor equal to its 1440 anchor — a degenerate ramp, i.e. a constant — so the type and the
 * box metrics are held at Figma's values at every width and only the WIDTH adapts:
 * `min(368px, 100vw - 24px)`, which is 368 from 392 upward and never lets the card reach either
 * edge below that. At 320 it is 296 wide, so nothing overflows and the page cannot pan.
 */

/**
 * `2074:3213` / `2074:3214` — the cookie glyph, 20x20, white inside the red badge.
 *
 * Inlined rather than written to `public/assets/figma/` because it is one path and because
 * `currentColor` lets the badge own the colour; the exported asset has `fill:white` baked in and
 * would need a second copy the day this card is ever inverted.

   * RESERVE THE SPACE THE CARD SITS IN, for as long as it is up.
   *
   * A `position: fixed` card is out of flow, so it covers whatever the bottom of the document
   * scrolls under it — and at the very bottom there is nothing left to scroll, so anything under
   * the card at that point is permanently unreachable. Measured at 402x780 with the page scrolled
   * to `scrollHeight`, `elementFromPoint` over each control's centre returned the card itself
   * for:
   *
   *   /register        ลงทะเบียน
   *   /register/team   เลือกสถานศึกษา, two inputs, ย้อนกลับ, ถัดไป
   *   /register/terms  two inputs, ถัดไป
   *   /  (402)         the Facebook and Instagram links in the footer
   *   /register/team   ถัดไป — at 1440 as well, so this was never only a phone problem
   *
   * i.e. a first-time visitor could not press ถัดไป at all. That is the brief's "must not cover
   * anything important", and no z-index fixes it: the card is genuinely on top of a control the
   * user has no way to scroll out from under.
   *
   * So the document is made taller by exactly the card's footprint, which is what a fixed bar is
   * supposed to do — the last content can then scroll clear above it. `document.body` rather than
   * the root, because the root carries the site's `overflow-x: clip` pan guard and
   * `useDialogFocus`'s scroll lock already writes to its inline style; body padding extends
   * `scrollHeight` just the same and keeps the two mechanisms from ever touching the same
   * property.
   *
   * Measured rather than assumed: the card is 167.9 tall at 320 (the Thai body wraps to a fourth
   * line) and 149.8 from 390 up, so a constant would be wrong at one end or the other. The
   * `ResizeObserver` also catches the reflow when the viewport crosses that wrap point.
   *
   * The inline value is saved and restored, never a computed one — the same discipline
   * `useScrollLock` documents, so this cannot leave a stray padding on the body after the card
   * has gone.
