/*
 * The two ramps these use are on the shared ladder in index.css, and both ends are now
 * Figma's: the 402 mobile Homepage frame (`1190:558`) gives this header block as a 354x30
 * number at y0 and a 354x39 title at y42 — a 20px/1.5 number and a 28px/1.4 title, 12
 * apart — against the verified 1440 values of 17.5 and 34.
 *
 * The number's ramp therefore DESCENDS (20 -> 17.5). That is not a slip: 20 is the
 * designer's phone value and 17.5 the verified desktop one, and the ladder is deliberately
 * tighter than Figma's 1440 marketing numbers.
 *
 * These are named rather than inlined so the three sections that build their own header
 * (ScopeSection, CodernSection, PastEvents) stay the same size as this one.
