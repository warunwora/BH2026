 * Figma authors it as a "Layout Container" wrapping an "Icon" pill, and the pill is what is

 * diameter is set by the glyph inside, not by the tone:
 *
 *   32 pill = 6 ring pad + 20 glyph + 6, wrapper `Layout Container` 32x32
 *     ok       `708:2652` `708:2761` `708:2771` `708:2815` (1440) / `1297:1394` (402)
 *     pending  `708:2662` (ตรวจสอบเอกสาร) `708:2849` `708:2927`
 *     alert    `708:2706` / `1297:2237`
 *     failed   `708:2971` (Semi-Final Failed — 20 close, NOT 16)
 *   28 pill = 6 + 16 glyph + 6, wrapper `Layout Container` 36x32 (4 pad either side, the
 *             pill centred in a 32-tall row)
 *     failed   `708:2883` (Not Qualified) — the ONLY compact badge in the whole design
 *
 * Two defects fixed here.
 *
 * 1. The pill rendered 2px over. `size-[32px] p-[4px]` on the wrapper left a 24 content box,
 *    but the pill inside computed 20 glyph + 12 ring pad + 2px of CSS `border` = 34 — a 34
 *    badge in a box Figma draws 32 (`708:2652`), overflowing the wrapper's padding. Figma's
 *    ring is an INSIDE stroke, so it is an inset box-shadow (the same trick `Step` already
 *    uses for the row hairline) and the wrapper's `p-[4px]` goes: 20 + 12 = 32 exactly, and
 *    the wrapper is the 32 square itself. This moves 1440 by 2px, deliberately.
 *
 * 2. `compact` was decided here, by tone — `compact || tone === 'failed'` — which forced the
 *    16 glyph onto BOTH failed variants. Figma disagrees: Not Qualified is 16 (`708:2883`)
 *    and Semi-Final Failed is 20 (`708:2971`). The diameter is now purely the step's own
 *    `compact` flag, authored per step in teamData.ts against those two nodes.
 *
 * Flat at both anchors: `1297:1393`/`1297:1394` on the 402 frame are byte-for-byte the 1440
 * `708:2652` — 32 wrapper, 6 ring pad, 20 glyph. Nothing here ramps.
 *
 * A badge is the one thing on this screen that changes meaning while the user is looking at
 * it — a step goes from pending to done — and it used to teleport: the pill's tint class and
 * the glyph asset both swapped in a single frame, so a review completing read as a glitch
 * rather than as progress. Two fixes, both cheap:
 *
 * - a transition on the pill's fill AND its inset ring, so the 10% tint and the 20% ring
 *   interpolate to the new tone instead of cutting. This covers every tone pair. (It names
 *   both properties because the ring is a box-shadow now, which `transition-colors` misses.)
 * - `mm-swap` on the pill, with the tone's own glyph and the check both permanently mounted
 *   in one grid cell. Nothing mounts or unmounts, so the completing transition — pending,
 *   alert or failed → ok, the direction a status actually travels — cross-fades on
 *   micro-motion's shared curve, the same way the copy button's tick does. Both layers are
 *   given the same box, so the pill cannot resize mid-cross-fade.
