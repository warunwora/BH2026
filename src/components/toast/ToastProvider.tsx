/**
 * The upload toasts' queue, their clocks, and the portal they render into.
 *
 * Imports styles/toast.css itself rather than relying on an `@import` in index.css, because
 * the toast track does not own index.css. Vite resolves a CSS import from a module into the
 * same bundled sheet, and every rule in it is unlayered, so it beats Tailwind's
 * `@layer utilities` regardless of which order the two sheets end up in — the cascade problem
 * micro-motion.css documents cannot bite here. Moving the line to index.css beside the other
 * four sheets is equivalent; see the report.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- the portal
 *
 * `document.body`, and not the component tree. Four page roots, the wizard shell, the auth
 * backdrop and five decoration bands in this app carry `overflow-clip`, and several carry a
 * `view-transition-name` or a transform — any one of which becomes the containing block for a
 * `position: fixed` descendant and would crop or displace a toast raised from inside it. The
 * uploads all live inside the wizard shell, so this is not hypothetical. Portalling also keeps
 * the stack out of the ancestor chain of `.site-nav-band`, so nothing here can create a
 * backdrop root and kill the nav's progressive blur.
