/**
 * The BangMod Hackathon 2026 masthead lockup — the painted "2026" with the tomato mascot
 * standing in for the zero, plus the two wordmarks.
 *
 * Figma draws it in TWO arrangements, and they are two different compositions rather than
 * two sizes of one:
 *
 *   WIDE     `935:451` — 810.508 x 421. One row: BangMod and Hackathon side by side across
 *            the top, "2026" underneath. 1.93:1.
 *   STACKED  `1190:672` — 311 x 232.566. Three rows: "2026" on top, then BangMod over
 *            Hackathon. 1.34:1, which is what lets a masthead this large exist on a phone.
 *
 * This file exists because BOTH the homepage hero and the sign-in screen want the stacked
 * one, and it was previously composed inline in Hero.tsx where nothing else could reach it:
 *
 *   Hero      `1190:672` at md-and-below, `935:451` above  (src/pages/Home.tsx → Hero.tsx)
 *   Sign in   `1214:102` on the 402 frame — a 320 x 256 RECTANGLE whose IMAGE fill is a
 *             FLATTENED raster of this exact stacked lockup, which is why an earlier pass
 *             concluded there was "no export in this repo" and shipped the horizontal
 *             wordmark instead. There is no separate export because it is the same drawing;
 *             see SignIn.tsx for how the 311-wide composition is fitted to that 320 slot.
 *
 * The extraction is deliberately a pure MOVE. `StackedLockup` and `WideLockup` return
 * fragments carrying the same elements, in the same order, with the same class strings that
 * Hero rendered inline, so the homepage's DOM — and therefore its layout at every width —
 * is unchanged.
 *
 * Both take their geometry from a pin box rather than from flow: Figma's lockup is one frame
 * with every piece placed in absolute px inside it, and re-expressing those px as
 * PERCENTAGES of the frame is what lets the whole masthead scale as a single unit at any
 * width. Render either one inside a `relative` box of the matching aspect ratio — the two
 * `*_ASPECT` constants below — and the pieces fill it.
