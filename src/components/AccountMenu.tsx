 * ============================================================================================
 * THE ACCOUNT CHIP, AND THE PLATE IT SITS ON
 * ============================================================================================
 *
 * One file, two exports, because they are one object: `AuthTopBar` is the white rounded plate
 * that carries the wordmark and the chip, and `AccountMenu` is the chip itself plus the
 * ออกจากระบบ disclosure that opens under it. Both used to be written out three times — in
 * `form/WizardShell`, in `AuthPageShell` and in `pages/MyTeam` — which is exactly why the chip
 * was a dead `<button>` in all three: there was no single place to put the behaviour.
 *
 * The plate is also what makes `auth-topbar` honest. That view-transition name is shared by the
 * gate, every wizard step and the two result screens, on the promise that the corner is ONE
 * object the browser carries between screens rather than two that crossfade. With three
 * hand-copied headers — one of which was not a plate at all — the promise was only nominally
 * kept. Now every screen in the flow renders this same element, so the snapshot really does
 * match on both sides of the hop.
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------- the open state in Figma
 *
 * The open dropdown is drawn on two dedicated frames, both named "Navigation Bar", both with
 * `clipsContent: false` so the panel is allowed to hang out of the bar:
 *
 *   `1359:931`  1040x94  the 1440 anchor — the bar, radius 24, 20 of padding
 *   `1359:971`   354x80  the  402 anchor — the bar, radius 20, 20 of padding
 *
 * They differ in KIND, not just in size, and that is the one thing this component has to get
 * right:
 *
 *   At 1440 (`1359:933`) the chip and the log-out row are a SINGLE bordered box — 210x114,
 *   radius 16, 1px #dcdcdc, white — with a 0.5px #dcdcdc hairline at y=56 inset to the
 *   content width (`1359:967`, 174 wide at x=20). The closed chip (`708:1271` / `1239:959`)
 *   is the top 52 of that same box at radius 12. So opening it is the box growing downward
 *   and its radius easing 12 → 16.
 *
 *   At 402 the panel DETACHES: `1359:1004` is its own 135x45 box, radius 16, 1px #dcdcdc,
 *   white, sitting 10px below the chip and right-aligned with it (both end at x=334, which is
 *   the bar's own 20 of right padding). No hairline — the gap is the separator. The chip
 *   itself stays 76x36 at radius 12 and takes a #f7f7f7 wash (`1359:974`).
 *
 * The split is at `sm`, and it is forced rather than chosen: the merged box needs the chip to
 * be as wide as the row inside it, and the chip is only that wide once the username is
 * visible. The username appears at `sm` (Figma hides it on every 402 frame — `1297:1459`,
 * `1239:953`, `1359:978` is 94 wide inside a 76-wide chip and simply overflows). So the panel
 * detaches at exactly the width the label disappears, which is the same breakpoint and the
 * same reason.

 *
 * ON THE OPEN STATE'S TWO CLASSES. `data-[open=true]:bg-[#f7f7f7]` is Figma's own open wash
 * (`1359:974`), and it is deliberately a surface change and nothing else. Figma ALSO drops the
 * chip's #dcdcdc stroke on that frame; this keeps it, because the border is pinned at #dcdcdc
 * in every state on this control by standing decision — the chip is neutral, it opens a menu,
 * and a border that changes on interaction reads as a validation state on a field. Only the
 * surface responds, at hover and at open alike.
 *
 * There is no radius TRANSITION, and that is a cascade fact rather than a taste one.
 * `.mm-press` writes an unlayered `transition` SHORTHAND (micro-motion.css documents this at
 * length), and a shorthand replaces rather than merges — so a `transition-[border-radius]`
 * utility written on this same element would be silently dropped, the way twenty
 * `hover:opacity-90`s were before that note existed. The radius therefore snaps while the box
 * unfolds around it, which at 220ms is not perceptible. Background-color IS in `.mm-press`'s
 * own list, so the wash is already timed at `--mm-fast`.
 *
 * `py` is 8 → 11, and the 11 is arithmetic rather than a transcription. Figma's chip `1297:558`
 * is 52 tall at 1440; ours measured 54, because 12 of padding either side of a 28px line box
 * plus the 1px border twice is 54. 11 gives 11 + 28 + 11 + 2 = 52 exactly. The low anchor is
 * unchanged at 8.000 (7.922 + 3.078 x 0.02535211), so the 402 chip stays 38 and its plate stays
 * at Figma's 80.
 *
 * This 2px was not cosmetic: the top bar is `p-5` around its tallest child, so a 54 chip made
 * the bar 94 where Figma draws 92, and every page that hangs off the bar inherited the error —
 * it is the whole reason the registration result card measured `top: 180 / height: 844` against
 * Figma's `178 / 846`. The card was already correct; the bar above it was pushing it down.

 * height: Figma's 114 is 12 + 28 + 16 + 0.5 + 16 + 30 + 12 with an INSIDE stroke that costs
 * nothing, where the CSS box pays 2px for the chip's real border (true of every bordered frame
 * in this repo) and rounds the 0.5px hairline up to the 1px a browser will actually paint. So
 * the open box measures 117 against Figma's 114. Nothing about the CLOSED chip moves, at any

/**
 * What ออกจากระบบ actually does.
 *
 * There is no auth backend in this repo — nothing is signed in, so nothing can be signed out —
 * and inventing a session layer is not this change's job. What the flow already models is that
 * /signin is where an unauthenticated visitor belongs: `Navbar` and `Hero` both send สมัคร
 * there, and `SignIn` is the screen that hands out the gate. So logging out is a navigation to
 * /signin, flagged `leave` — wizardNav's own name for a hop that carries nothing over, which is
 * exactly right here: the pasta and the colour blocks both belong to the flow being left, and a
 * plain crossfade is what should happen. Every other hop in this flow is direction-aware for
 * the back button's sake and this one is too, for free, because `useAuthNavigate` records the
 * hop on the history entry.
 *
 * The moment a real session exists, this is the one call site to change.

/**
 * The white plate: the wordmark, and the account chip in the far corner.
 *
 * Figma draws exactly this on every screen of the flow — `1239:947` / `1239:957` (the gate),
 * `1297:1453` / `1359:931` (the wizard), `1297:427` / `1297:603` / `1297:556` (the results),
 * `1297:1280` / `708:2308` (the dashboard) — same 20 of padding, same shadow, same two
 * children, at 354x80 on the 402 frames and 92 tall at 1440. `p-5` is therefore flat, not a
 * ramp: 20 is the padding on the phone frame as well as at 1440.
 *
 * `className` carries each shell's own concerns — the `auth-topbar` view-transition name, the
 * dashboard's `auth-rise` entrance — and the rest of the props go straight through so
 * `data-rise` can too.
