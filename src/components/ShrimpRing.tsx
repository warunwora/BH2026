/**
 * The eight-shrimp pinwheel — Figma frame `1297:2115` "Shrimp", and the same drawing wherever
 * it appears. It is the 404's centre glyph (708:1240, standing in for the 0) and the second O
 * of /coming-soon's painted "COMING S🦐ON" (1419:2037 at 1440, 1423:2060 on the phone board).
 *
 * Those three are ONE ring at three sizes, which is why this file exists rather than a second
 * coordinate table next to the second page. Checked against Figma before extracting: every
 * box in 1419:2037 is the 404's own row times 0.337278 (shrimp 1: 193.85 -> 65.382, 64.92 ->
 * 22.024, 253.848 -> 85.618) and 1423:2060 is the same rows times 0.18, in the same order,
 * with the same eight angles. So the geometry below is stated once, in fractions of its own
 * box, and each caller supplies the box.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------ using it
 *
 * Renders `absolute inset-0`, so give it a `relative` box of `SHRIMP_RING_ASPECT`:
 *
 *     <div className="relative" style={{ width: RING_W, height: RING_H }}><ShrimpRing /></div>
 *
 * The box may be sized in px, in percentages of a parent, or by anything else — everything
 * inside is a percentage of it, so the ring is resolution-independent. That is what lets
 * /coming-soon drop it into the word art at `width: 14.2871%` of the art's own box and have
 * it land exactly where Figma's flattened copy of it was.
