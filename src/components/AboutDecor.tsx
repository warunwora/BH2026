 * The About page's page-level decorations — the soft out-of-focus food behind the four
 * sections. In Figma they live in one consolidated "About - Background" frame (935:858),
 * 1440x4888, anchored to the top of the page, painted entirely behind the section
 * content — so they render here as a single 1440-wide canvas at the back of the page.
 * (The Star mascot is not part of that frame; it stays a foreground piece of FaqSection.)
 *
 * The page-absolute canvas is desktop-only: below `lg` the sections do not have Figma's
 * fixed heights, so a page y lands nowhere near the content it belongs to. It used to be
 * the *whole* file, which left every phone with a blank white guide page — 39 of the page's
 * decorations simply absent. The same art is drawn below `lg` by `<Narrow>` at the bottom of
 * this file: the frame's four groups, each as a `.decor-stage` — the group's own px geometry,
 * scaled by `--decor-fit` (100vw/1440, see styles/pasta-motion.css) about the corner it is
 * pinned by, and pinned to a page edge or to a measured section rather than to a page y.

 * ------------------------------------------------------------------- garlic
 *
 * Three heaps of garlic between the FAQ and the Contact section. Each heap is a Figma
 * *frame* of six bulbs turned to roughly 60deg intervals, so the six read as one whole,
 * splayed bulb rather than as six loose cloves — and getting that reading right is the
 * whole difficulty here, because the frame is rotated and Figma reports two boxes for it:
 *
 *   - the **bbox** (`x/y/w/h` below), the axis-aligned box the rotated frame occupies in
 *     its parent — this is what `get_metadata` returns and it is where the heap *sits*;
 *   - the **inner box** (`iw/ih`), the frame's own unrotated size, centred in the bbox —
 *     this is the space the six bulbs are laid out in, and it is 20-25% smaller.
 *
 * This file previously read the bbox as the layout space and dropped the frame rotation
 * entirely, which scaled every bulb up by ~1.35 and pushed the heaps a few hundred px down
 * and right; at that size the six bulbs no longer overlapped, so the pile came apart into
 * separate cloves and only two of them were left on the 1440 canvas. `get_metadata` also
 * reports a rotated frame's `x/y` as the position of its *rotated* top-left corner, not of
 * the bbox — Row 1 reads (93, 181.5) there but its bbox top is 13 — so the row positions
 * below are taken from `get_design_context`, which states the bbox directly.
 *
 * Inside a heap the same two-box rule applies per bulb: `w/h` is the container Figma sizes
 * from the inner box, `aw/ah` the art box (its `hypot()` maths) centred in it and turned by
 * `rot`. Everything is transcribed; `scratch/calc.mjs`-style arithmetic is not repeated at
 * runtime. Check: Row 1's six containers tile its inner box exactly (right edge 579.79,
 * bottom 564.48), which is what proves the inner box is the right layout space.
