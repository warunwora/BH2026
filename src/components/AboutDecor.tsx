/**
 * The About page's page-level decorations — the soft out-of-focus food behind the four
 * sections. In Figma they live in one consolidated "About - Background" frame (935:858),
 * 1440x4888, anchored to the top of the page, painted entirely behind the section
 * content — so they render here as a single 1440-wide canvas at the back of the page.
 * (The Star mascot is not part of that frame; it stays a foreground piece of FaqSection.)
 *
 * The page-absolute canvas is desktop-only: away from 1440 the sections do not have Figma's
 * fixed heights, so a page y lands nowhere near the content it belongs to. It used to be
 * the *whole* file, which left every phone with a blank white guide page — 39 of the page's
 * decorations simply absent. The same art is drawn below that by `<Narrow>` at the bottom of
 * this file: the frame's four groups, each as a `.decor-stage` — the group's own px geometry,
 * scaled by `--decor-fit` (100vw/1440, see styles/pasta-motion.css) about the corner it is
 * pinned by, and pinned to a page edge or to a measured section rather than to a page y.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------- why the switch is at 1440, not lg
 *
 * The page-absolute path is only *correct* where the code's own section stack comes to the
 * frame's 4888, and that is 1440 and up — nowhere else, and `lg` was never it. The stack
 * shortens as the viewport narrows, because the type ladder (index.css) is deliberately
 * tighter than Figma's 1440 marketing sizes while the column shrinks with the gutter: at
 * 1024 the four sections measure out ~4260 against the canvas's 4888. Pinned at page y, the
 * consequences in the 1024–1440 band were all of the same kind and all visible:
 *
 * - the tomatoes and the pots, pinned at 4515/4581, sat ~630px BELOW the address plate,
 *   inside the white the page wrapper's `min-h` had to invent to reach 4888;
 * - the garlic band, pinned at 3196, landed a quarter of the way down the contact section
 *   instead of on the seam above it;
 * - the cream field (`935:1125`), pinned at 2332, no longer coincided with the copy
 *   FaqSection paints on its own box — two curved bands a few hundred px apart.
 *
 * Below 1440 every group therefore hangs off something that exists at any height, which is
 * exactly what `<Narrow>` already did below `lg`; only the width it starts at moved. At
 * 1440 itself the two paths are the same drawing: `--decor-fit` is 1, the page wrapper is
 * the frame's 4888, so the bottom-pinned stage puts the tomatoes at 4515 and the pots at
 * 4581 — the pins, arrived at from the other end.

 * the corner `get_metadata` reports, which for 0 < th < 90 is exactly (x + ih·sin th, y) —
 * validated against the desktop pair, where this file already records that Pasta 1 "reads
 * x = 1226.6 there; its box starts at 683.73" and 683.73 + 861.154·sin 39.08 = 1226.44.

/*
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------- garlic
 *
 * Three heaps of garlic between the FAQ and the Contact section. Each heap is a Figma
 * *frame* of six bulbs turned to roughly 60deg intervals, so the six read as one whole,
 * splayed bulb rather than as six loose cloves — and getting that reading right is the
 * whole difficulty here, because the frame is rotated and Figma reports two boxes for it:
 *
 *   - the **bbox** (`x/y/w/h` below), the axis-aligned box the rotated frame occupies in
 *     its parent — this is what `get_metadata` returns and it is where the heap *sits*;
 *   - the **inner box** (`iw/ih`), the frame's own unrotated size, centred in the bbox —
 *     this is the space the six bulbs are laid out in, and it is 20-25% smaller.
 *
 * This file previously read the bbox as the layout space and dropped the frame rotation
 * entirely, which scaled every bulb up by ~1.35 and pushed the heaps a few hundred px down
 * and right; at that size the six bulbs no longer overlapped, so the pile came apart into
 * separate cloves and only two of them were left on the 1440 canvas. `get_metadata` also
 * reports a rotated frame's `x/y` as the position of its *rotated* top-left corner, not of
 * the bbox — Row 1 reads (93, 181.5) there but its bbox top is 13 — so the row positions
 * below are taken from `get_design_context`, which states the bbox directly.
 *
 * Inside a heap the same two-box rule applies per bulb: `w/h` is the container Figma sizes
 * from the inner box, `aw/ah` the art box (its `hypot()` maths) centred in it and turned by
 * `rot`. Everything is transcribed; `scratch/calc.mjs`-style arithmetic is not repeated at
 * runtime. Check: Row 1's six containers tile its inner box exactly (right edge 579.79,
 * bottom 564.48), which is what proves the inner box is the right layout space.

/*
 * ------------------------------------------------- the garlic the PHONE frame actually shows
 *
 * It is there, and the note in `Phone()` below used to say it was not. That reading was taken
 * from a metadata dump in which the phone frame's garlic was still `1190:1298`, a stray copy
 * left at the DESKTOP frame's own (867, 3196) at desktop size — 465px past the right edge of a
 * 402 canvas, genuinely invisible. The live file has replaced it: the phone's garlic is
 * `1343:438`, a NEW node, and it is not a loose child of the frame at all — it is a child of
 * the FAQ section `1190:1338`, which is why the section-name-off-by-one tables never listed it.
 *
 *   `1343:438` "Garlic"   bbox 378.137 x 345.345 at (152.21, 931.66) INSIDE `1190:1338`
 *                         i.e. page (152.21, 3092.66) on the 402 frame, x running to 530.35 so
 *                         the right third bleeds off the canvas, exactly as Figma renders it
 *                         (screenshot of `1190:1338`: three heaps at the bottom right, straddling
 *                         the seam with §04).
 *
 * `get_metadata` reports it at (192.71, 931.66) because the group is TURNED — its own unrotated
 * size is 340.704 x 302.443 and it carries `rotate(7.7deg)`, so what metadata gives is the
 * rotated top-left corner. Checked: the bbox centre (341.279, 1104.332) plus
 * R(7.7)·(-170.352, -151.221) is (192.72, 931.65), which is metadata's pair to 0.01px.
 *
 * -------------------------------------------------------------- and it is the desktop group
 *
 * Not a re-layout: the phone garlic is the 1440 group at ONE uniform scale, which is what lets
 * `HEAPS` and `GarlicHeap` above be reused verbatim rather than transcribed a second time.
 * `get_design_context` states the frame's own size as 340.704 x 302.443 against the desktop
 * frame's 811.808 x 721.604 — 0.419685 and 0.419122 — and every group inside lands on the same
 * factor from its stated inset, independently:
 *
 *            desktop (this file)          x 0.4196851      Figma's phone inset
 *   Wave 3   (136, 116) 597 x 378         (57.08, 48.68) 250.55 x 158.64   (57.07, 48.63) 250.55 x 158.42
 *   Heap 1   ( 93,  13) 718.81 x 708.60   (39.03,  5.46) 301.66 x 297.39   (39.05,  5.44) 301.66 x 297.00
 *   Heap 2   (  0,   0) 547.66 x 540.12   ( 0,     0   ) 229.84 x 226.68   ( 0,     0   ) 229.79 x 226.38
 *   Heap 3   ( 91, 226) 491.74 x 473.10   (38.19, 94.85) 206.41 x 198.58   (38.19, 94.73) 206.37 x 198.28
 *
 * — four independent agreements to within 0.15%, and the wave's scaled width (250.55) is to
 * three decimals the intrinsic width of Figma's own phone re-export of that SVG (250.552 x
 * 158.43), which is why the repo's existing 597x378 export is reused: both declare
 * `preserveAspectRatio="none"`, so they are the same drawing at two export scales.
 *
 * Two numbers Figma also emits are NOT used, because they cannot both be right and neither
 * agrees with the four checks above: `get_metadata`'s per-row `w`/`h` imply a scale of 0.387,
 * and the `hypot(… cqw, … cqh)` widths in the phone's own `get_design_context` imply 0.4554.
 * They straddle 0.4197 by a factor of ~1.085 in each direction. The frame size and all four
 * insets agree with each other, so they are the reading taken.
 *
 * Rows 2 and 3 keep this file's `rotate(...) scaleY(-1)`, which is Figma's phone pair written
 * the other way round and NOT the transform-order trap: Figma emits row 2 as the individual
 * properties `scale: -1 1` + `rotate: 16.88deg`, composing to R(16.88)·Sx, and
 * R(16.88)·Sx = R(16.88)·Sy·R(180) = R(-163.12)·Sy — the matrix `HEAPS[1]`'s
 * `rotate(-163.1deg) scaleY(-1)` already builds. Same identity for row 3 (-163.12 / +16.9).
 *
 * The phone group does NOT clip (no `overflow-clip` on `1343:438`) and does NOT carry the
 * desktop frame's second, coincident copy of heap 1 (`935:1299`), so neither is drawn here —
 * `1343:438`'s children are the wave and the three rows and nothing else.

 * it — it hangs off that section's closing edge, so it is not part of this page canvas at all.

 * DESKTOP band at `left: calc(867px * var(--decor-fit))`, which at 402 is x 242 — the middle of
 * the screen — so that path still must not run on the phone, and does not.

       * right here, hard-pinned at `left: -794, top: 2332` — Figma's own page coordinates for
       * it. It has been REMOVED, because `FaqSection` paints the same node itself, at every
       * width, anchored to its own section box. Two copies of one node were being drawn.
       *
       * The two did not coincide, and could not: this canvas pins to the 1440 FRAME's y
       * (2332), while the field belongs to the FAQ SECTION, which starts at a measured 2209.2
       * — every section above it is shorter than Figma's because the type ladder is tighter
       * and the accordion ships collapsed. So from 1440 up the band was painted twice, 152.8px
       * apart, and the doubled curve is the "พื้นหลังตรงนี้ยังมั่ว ๆ" that was reported twice:
       * the lower copy's bottom edge reached page 3495 and put cream behind the `04` /

       * #FFEAB4 field behind the FAQ is deliberately not here: FaqSection paints that field
       * itself, at every width, centred on its own box — which is a better anchor for it than
       * anything this canvas could offer". That reasoning is not width-dependent; this branch
       * simply had not been brought in line with it. Now both branches agree, and the band is
       * continuous across the 1440 boundary instead of gaining a second copy at it.
