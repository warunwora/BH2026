/*
 * The `CENTRED = [1, 2]` special case that used to live here is GONE, and it is worth saying
 * why, because it *was* a faithful transcription of a Figma property.
 *
 * 708:281 / 708:286 (the two middle titles) really are `x: 2.5, width: 315` inside a 320 card
 * — a centred text node. But that offset is 2.5px only because at Figma's own 30px the title
 * measures 315 of the 320 available, so centring it is visually indistinguishable from flush
 * left. This repo renders the same title on the shared ladder's 26px (see TITLE below), where
 * it measures ~278 — so `items-center` put it 21px in from its own card's left edge while the
 * white plate above it stayed flush, which is exactly the "text starts left of / wider than
 * its card" complaint. Figma's own render of 708:264 shows all four captions flush left.
 *
 * So the property was transcribed correctly and still produced the wrong picture: it encodes
 * "fills its column", not "is centred in it". Flush left at every column width is the reading
 * that survives the type ramp.

         * a card of width W at any size up to W/10.47, i.e. 9.55cqi; 9.2 keeps a little back for
         * the fallback face, which is wider. The ladder value is the cap, so the `min()` only

         *
         * So the only place the ladder gives way is the four-up row, by ~1px, because Figma's
         * four 320 cards do not fit the 1200 column it also declares (see the grid below).
         * Losing 1px of title there is a smaller lie than a wrapped title, which is what the
         * previous `min-h: 2.8em` + `overflow-wrap: anywhere` pair was managing rather than
         * preventing — both are gone, along with the two-line baseline reservation they needed.

         * ------------------------------------------------------------------ the 1400 problem
         *
         * Figma sizes all four cards 320 wide on 40 gaps = 1400 (708:273/278/283/288 at x 0 /
         * 360 / 720 / 1080), but declares their parent `Prize Cards` 708:272 — and the grid
         * 708:271 above it — as 1200, at x120 in the 1440 frame. The row therefore overflows
         * its own container by 200 and the fourth card runs from 1200 to 1520, i.e. 80 past the
         * frame edge, where Figma clips it: the ชมเชย prize is unreadable in Figma's own render
         * of 708:264. The file is internally inconsistent and something has to give.
         *
         * A previous round gave up the container: it kept the 320 cards and centred the whole
         * 1400 track in the frame (`-mx-[100px] w-[1400px]`), on the grounds that no content is
         * lost that way. That is wrong twice over, and both are visible at 1440:
         *
         *   - the row started at x20 while the heading started at x120, so the grid bled 100px
         *     left of the section's own heading and 100px past its right edge. The header
         *     (708:266) and the grid (708:271) are BOTH x120 w1200 — one container, one set of
         *     gutters — and that is the one thing the file is unambiguous about.
         *   - it was a fixed 1400px. Between `lg` and 1440 the column is narrower than that, so
         *     the track simply overflowed and the fourth card was cut off by the page's own
         *     `overflow-x-clip` — the clipping bug reproduced in the browser, at every width
         *     except the single one it was measured at.
         *
         * So the container wins and the cards give: four columns in the shared 1200 column on
         * Figma's own 40 gap = (1200 - 3*40) / 4 = 270 each at 1440. Nothing is hardcoded to
         * that number — `grid-cols-4` derives it from whatever the container is, so the row
         * stays flush with the heading at every width and above 1440 too (`--fl` freezes, the
         * column caps at 1200, the cards stay 270). The one consequence is that the longest
         * title now wraps; see the `min-h` on the card's h3.
         */}
        {/*
         * Re-read live off Figma 708:271 "Prizes Grid" (2026-07-31). Settling the question a
         * previous round got wrong twice:
         *
         *   - The plate is `Light Background`, a plain `bg-white rounded-[12px]` square with
         *     no fill and no child. Figma really does reserve an empty box — there is no
         *     missing export to go and find. So it stays, per "ทำตาม Figma ไปเลย".
         *   - Cards 2 and 3 centre their text block (`items-center`), 1 and 4 do not. That one
         *     HAS been dropped — see the note where `CENTRED` used to be, at the top of the
         *     file: transcribed correctly, it still draws the wrong picture on this repo's type.
         *
         * The carousel is Figma's PHONE reading and now stops at `md`. 1190:757 declares a
         * 354-wide box and then puts the four 260-wide cards at x 0 / 284 / 568 / 852 inside
         * it — an 1112-wide track in a 354 window on a 24 gap. That is a horizontal carousel,
         * and it is built as one below: a real scroll container, snapped, no visible scrollbar.
         *
         * It used to run all the way to `lg`, which meant an iPad at 834 or a 1023-wide window
         * got the phone's sideways rail where the desktop composition is a grid flush with the
         * section heading. From `md` up it is a grid at both widths; only the column count
         * differs, and the count is the one thing that cannot ramp:
         *
         *   - four columns in the 1200 column at 1440 is Figma's row (see above), 270 a card.
         *   - four columns at 768 is (652 - 3*29.9) / 4 = 140 a card. `รางวัลรองชนะเลิศอันดับ 1`
         *     measures ~258 at the 24.7px the ramp gives there, so every one of the two middle
         *     titles would take three lines broken mid-cluster by `overflow-wrap: anywhere`
         *     (Thai has no spaces; see the note on the h3). Two columns give 311 at 768 and 412
         *     at 1023 — one line each, and the plate is still 47% of the column against
         *     desktop's 22.5%, which is as near Figma's row as 768 has room for.
         *
         * The rail is pulled out to the screen edges by the section's own gutter and the
         * gutter is re-applied as the track's padding, so the first card is flush to the 24
         * gutter (1190:757 sits at x24) and the cards can still bleed to the bezel as they
         * scroll. `pb`/`-mb` cancel in layout and exist only to give the reveal's
         * translateY(24px) somewhere to live inside a box that has to clip its Y axis.
         *
         * From `md` the wrapper is `display: contents` — it leaves the layout entirely rather
         * than becoming a second box the row would have to escape from, so from 768 up the
         * track is the same direct child of the 1200 column it always was. Its own
         * `-mx-[var(--fl-gutter)]` goes with it: a `display: contents` box has no margins,
         * which is why the track below has no `md:mx-0` to cancel. It is also what keeps the
         * page from panning sideways above `md`: with the box gone there is no scrollport left.
