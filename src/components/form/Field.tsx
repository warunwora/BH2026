/**
 * Figma's field primitives (708:1311 and its siblings). Every control is a rounded-12
 * box with a 0.8px #dcdcdc hairline and 12 of padding around an 18px line, and every
 * label pairs a 20px medium name with an 18px red asterisk on a 6 gap.
 *
 * The type in this file is written as explicit two-anchor ramps, NOT as the flat-px ranks it
 * used to use. The ranks have floors (`fl-18` bottoms out at 16, `fl-20` at 17) and Figma's
 * phone frame goes under them nearly everywhere here — labels are 14 (`1214:221`), upload
 * captions 12 (`1239:1312`), document rows 14 (`1239:1303`) — so the floors were rendering the
 * phone form 2–5px over frame on ~40 nodes per step, which is most of why /register read as
 * oversized on a phone. Every ramp below still resolves to its exact 1440 value at `--fl` = 1.
 *
 * The one place the floor STAYS is `BOX`, the control's own text — see its note.
 *
 * Focus used to snap: the border went red in one frame, on around twenty fields per entrant
 * step, and `focus:outline-none` had removed the platform's own ring without putting anything
 * in its place. 160ms is `--mm-fast` and the curve is `--mm-ease` — the same pair every other
 * hover and colour change in the app takes — and the 3px ring at 12% is opacity-only paint on
 * a `box-shadow`, so it costs no layout and restores the affordance the outline reset took.
 */
/*
 * The padding and the radius are two-anchor ramps rather than the 1440 values held flat.
 * `1214:223` / `1214:229` draw the control with 8 of padding on an 8 radius on the 402 frame
 * (a 34-tall box) against `708:1315` / `708:1321`'s 12 on 12 at 1440 (51 tall). Held at 12
 * the phone control was 8px taller than the frame's, twenty-odd times per entrant step, which
 * is most of why /register/entrant/1 reads as too big on a phone. Both land on 12.000 at
 * `--fl` = 1, so no 1440 control moves.
 *
 * The TYPE stays `fl-18` — the one deliberate size departure in this file. Figma's phone value
 * is 12 (`1214:224`) against 18 at 1440 (`708:1316`), and the rank holds 16 at the phone end.
 *
 * Not a judgement call about legibility: iOS Safari ZOOMS THE PAGE when a focused input's
 * font-size is under 16px, and it does not zoom back out. Every field on /register would punch
 * the layout to ~1.2x on tap and leave the page pannable sideways — the one thing the phone
 * work is under standing instruction never to do. 16px is the documented threshold, so this is
 * the floor doing exactly the job it exists for. The ramp above still shrinks the BOX itself to
 * the frame's 34-tall control, so the field's geometry is Figma's; only the glyphs inside it
 * are 4px larger than drawn.

 * ------------------------------------------------------------------- the transfer, and why
 *
 * Figma's toast set (1359:1024, 1359:1142, 1359:1117, 1359:1161, 1359:1185) draws a transfer
 * with a progress bar, a pause and a retry — five states that need something to be actually
 * happening, and the note above is right that this project has no backend to make it happen.
 *
 * So the transfer is a real READ, not a fake request. The file is walked in chunks with
 * `Blob.slice().arrayBuffer()`, and `loaded` is bytes that genuinely came off the disk. That
 * buys three things a `setInterval` counting to 100 would not:
 *
 *  - the progress bar is honest. It is the same number the caption prints.
 *  - `failed` (1359:1161) is REACHABLE, and for a real reason. A `File` handle is a pointer
 *    into the filesystem: move, rename, delete or unmount the thing between the picker
 *    closing and the read finishing and the slice throws `NotReadableError`. That is exactly
 *    the "upload failed part-way" the frame draws, including a partial byte count to print in
 *    it, and it is the one failure a browser-only app can genuinely have. Nothing here ever
 *    fails at random — a registration form that sometimes rejects a good file on purpose
 *    would be hostile.
 *  - pause and resume are real. The loop parks between chunks, so the bar stops where the
 *    bytes stopped.
 *
 * `READ_PACE_MS` is the one deliberate lie, and it is pacing rather than data: 24 slices of a
 * 5 MB file resolve in well under 100ms total, which would make the in-flight state a single
 * flashed frame. Holding each tick to ~58ms puts a transfer at roughly 1.4s — long enough to
 * see, short enough that nobody is waiting on it — while every byte reported is still a byte
 * that was read. 24 slices is also what gives the bar its granularity: 4% a step, which at
 * 348 wide is 14px, comfortably more than the 1px that would make the transition pointless.

 * padding, and the reserved right padding is offset + mark + offset, i.e. 32 → 44. `pr-11` was

 * is the one to keep — but the native indicator is also the thing that OPENS the picker, and
 * Figma's is `pointer-events-none`, so hiding the native one outright would leave a date field
 * with a decorative icon and no way to pick a date except by typing.
 *
 * So the native indicator is made invisible and STRETCHED over the whole reserved trailing zone
 * instead: `opacity: 0` with the same 32 → 44 width `TRAIL` reserves. Figma's glyph sits on top
 * of it, the click still lands on the real control, and the hit area is now the whole glyph
 * region rather than the browser's own smaller box.
 *
 * Firefox draws no indicator at all, so it never had the duplicate and is unaffected.
