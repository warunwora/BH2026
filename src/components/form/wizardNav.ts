/**
 * Direction and capability plumbing for the auth-flow view transitions.
 *
 * The View Transitions API has no notion of where the user came from — one navigation
 * looks like any other — so the shape of each hop has to be published to CSS out of
 * band. `markAuthNav` stamps `data-auth-nav` on the root element, which the
 * `:root[data-auth-nav='…']` rules in styles/auth-motion.css read to pick that hop's
 * choreography.
 *
 * There is exactly one writer: `trackAuthNav`, which is subscribed to the router itself
 * (see App.tsx). Subscribers are called synchronously from the router's `updateState`,
 * which is two React effect passes before `<RouterProvider>` reaches
 * `document.startViewTransition` — so the flag is always in place before the transition
 * that reads it starts, whether the navigation came from a link, a button, or the
 * browser's own back button. Nothing has to clean it up, since the attribute only ever
 * selects pseudo-elements that exist mid-transition.

 *  - `gate`    sign-in → the registration gate: the colour blocks morph, the plate arrives
 *  - `enter`   the gate → the first wizard step: colour sinks away, the pasta spills in
 *  - `forward` step → step
 *  - `submit`  the last step → the success or error screen: pasta leaves, colour returns
 *  - `leave`   out of the flow, with nothing left to carry — a plain crossfade
 *
 * …and `back`, `gate-back`, `enter-back`, `submit-back`, which are those four run the
 * other way. Every forward hop has a reverse, because every one of them is reachable by
