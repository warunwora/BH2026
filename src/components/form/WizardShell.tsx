/**
 * THE CARD'S INSET, and the one number this whole file now hangs off.
 *
 * 20 @402 → 24 @1440, where this was 20 → 40. The 40 came from the OLD desktop frames
 * (`708:1279` and friends); every frame of the current redesign says 24 on all four sides —
 * `2053:138` (terms), `2053:247` (team), `2053:348` (advisor), `2053:528` (entrant 1),
 * `2053:724` (entrant 2) are each `padding: 24` on a 1040 card, which is what makes the
 * content column 992 rather than the 960 it was rendering.
 *
 * The one dissenter is `2053:1044` (the "Modal" frame), which still carries the old
 * 40/40/40/160 — it is a stale clone of the pre-redesign card and the only 2053 node that
 * disagrees with the other five. Five to one, and the five are the step frames the user
 * named, so 24 it is.
 *
 * The ACTION BAR uses the same expression, and that is the point of extracting it. Figma
 * pins ถัดไป on the card's own inset — `2053:209` ends at x1216 of a card that ends at 1240,
 * and `2053:314` / `2053:494` / `2053:686` do the same — i.e. the pill is inset EXACTLY as
 * far as the content above it. The old bar cancelled the card's padding with a negative
 * margin and then re-applied a flat 20 of its own, so the pill sat 20 from the frame while
 * the fields sat 40 from it: the button visibly broke out of the column and hugged the
 * edge. One value, spent once, and the two cannot drift.
 *
 * It is an inline `style` and not a Tailwind arbitrary value BECAUSE it is shared. Tailwind
 * scans source text for literal class names, so `p-[${CARD_PAD}]` would never be emitted —
 * the only way to spend one expression in two places is to hand it to the style attribute.

             * It is FULL BLEED and opaque, which it has to be now: the form slides underneath
             * it, so a transparent bar or one inset by the card's padding would let fields show
             * through beside and behind the pills. `-mx`/`-mb` of `CARD_PAD` take it out to the
             * card's three edges, and the same `CARD_PAD` back as padding puts the pills on
             * exactly the inset the form column above them uses — which is Figma's own reading:
             * `2053:209` ends 24 from a card that ends at 1240, `2053:314` / `2053:494` /
             * `2053:686` likewise. One value, spent once, so the two cannot drift.
             *
             * The bottom corners are `CARD_RADIUS`, from the same constant the card's own
             * radius comes from — `2053:208` is `[0, 0, 24, 24]` against the card's 24. Square
             * at the top, where it meets the form; the card's curve at the bottom, where it
             * meets the fold.
             *
             * NO rule along its top edge, deliberately. Figma draws none (`2053:208` has a fill
             * and no stroke), and a border here is exactly the stray divider this pass was sent
             * to remove.
             *
             * `flex-wrap` is a safety net, not a layout: at 375 the terms step's pair is a 24px
             * icon plus "ลงทะเบียนเข้าแข่งขัน", which is within a few px of the 293 this row has,
             * and a wrap is a far better failure than a pill hanging out of the card.

/**
 * Figma's step buttons: rounded-12, a 12 gap and asymmetric padding around the icon.
 *
 * The press is not from Figma — a pressable control has to confirm it heard the press. It
 * used to be typed out here as `transition-[opacity,transform] duration-[160ms] ease-out
 * active:scale-[0.97]`, which is `mm-press` written by hand at a different duration to the
 * same gesture everywhere else in the app; the class is the one definition, at 110ms, and it
 * carries its own reduced-motion guard.
 *
 * WEIGHT — the one item this pass was sent to settle. `font-medium` (500) is CORRECT, and the
 * suspicion that it was an outlier against the site's other red pills is wrong: the wizard pill
 * is Medium at BOTH anchors, on eleven nodes, with no disagreement anywhere.
 *

 *          `708:1531` · `708:1533` · `708:1737` · `708:1739`  all 20/500
 *   @402   `1214:251` ถัดไป 16/500 · `1243:2375` ย้อนกลับ 16/500 · `1243:2377` submit 16/500
 *          `1297:107` · `1297:109` · `1297:1571` · `1297:1573`  all 16/500
 *
 * The brief's reading that the 402 pill is glyph-only and therefore has no phone anchor for the
 * label holds for the two NAV pills, whose 36x36 box clips the label out — but the terms step's
 * submit keeps its label on the phone frame (`1243:2376`, 166x38), so there IS a phone anchor and
 * it says 500 too. Not a breakpoint, not a mismatch: one flat weight.
 *
 * TWO ANCHORS for the block padding, the gap and the label.
 * Figma's phone action bar is a 36-tall pill — `1297:1568` / `1214:250` / `1243:2372` are 36x36
 * with a 20 glyph on an 8 inset, `1243:2376` is 166x38 with a 22-tall label on a 16 — against
 * `708:1342` / `708:2012`'s 60 with a 24 glyph on a 16/18 inset at 1440. So:
 *
 *   py     8 @402 → 16 @1440   (`py-4` was the whole 1440 inset on a 36-tall pill)
 *   gap    8 @402 → 12 @1440   (see below)
 *   label 16 @402 → 20 @1440   spelled out rather than left as `fl-20`
 *
 * GAP was `gap-3`, held flat on the reading that the phone pill has no label to space. Every one
 * of the four phone pills declares `itemSpacing: 8` — including `1243:2376`, which does carry a
 * label — against 12 on `708:1342` / `708:2012` / `708:2016`. So there are two anchors and it
 * ramps. Below `sm` the nav pills are a single child and the value is inert; from `sm` up, and on
 * the submit at every width, it is the real spacing.
 *
 * LABEL is written out because `fl-20`'s floor is 17, and 17 is not 16: the submit keeps its
 * label at 402, so that floor was a visible 1px overshoot on the one pill that shows one down
 * there. From `sm` up the two expressions agree to within 0.08px, so 1440 does not move.
 *
 * RADIUS is a flat 12 and that is both anchors, not one held: every pill above is `r: 12`.
